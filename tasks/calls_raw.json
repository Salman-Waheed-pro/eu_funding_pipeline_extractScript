            "Expected Outcome:\nFor supported researchers:\nConcrete career prospects and increased career stability\nAccess to diverse career pathways in and outside academia\nDeeper and more diverse set of research-related, academic and transferable skills and competences, leading to greater autonomy\nFor participating organisations:\nBetter alignment of research and Human Resources practices, including recruitment, career accession and progression systems, at participating organisation(s) with the European Charter for Researchers and the Council Recommendation of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe and the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment;\nIncreased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation of the participating organisation(s);\nStronger R&I and teaching capacity and output;\nIncreased contribution to the local, regional and/or national socio-economic ecosystems;\nStronger synergies across institutional research, management and teaching structures.\nScope:\nThe objective of this new scheme is to tackle brain drain and precarity of researchers' careers to make Europe more attractive to the most promising young talents. Applicants submit proposals for talent recruitment programmes that will provide researchers holding a doctoral degree with excellent research and academic opportunities, potentially coupled with management activities, to lead them to concrete and attractive career prospects. This will have an impact on the enhancement of human resources in R&I at institutional, regional, national or international level. These programmes will be co-funded by MSCA Choose Europe for Science.\nThe programmes will be divided into two phases. A first phase (24-36 months) in which the EU funding is equivalent to the minimum gross salary for the recruited researcher during this phase and a second phase (24 months) in which the applicant is expected to continue to employ the researcher, set salaries attractive at a national level and ensure availability of the necessary internal or external funds.\nProposed programmes can cover any research disciplines. The selection procedure for candidates must be open, competitive, merit-based and with a transparent international peer-review in line with the European Charter for Researchers[1]. Alignment with the principles outlined in the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment[2] is also encouraged. Selection criteria should be based primarily on excellence. Additional selection criteria require clear alignment with local human resources needs identified in the relevant institutional, regional or national strategies. These must be described in the proposal and must be listed in the vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS website[3]) alongside the gross salaries applicable to the two programme phases (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions). Selected fellows will be able to work in research, teaching or management positions and, where relevant, define their own research topic at their host institution(s). The programmes should aim at offering excellent working conditions to researchers, including salary, professional resources, and career development.\nThe career development should incorporate transversal skills but also job-specific skills and, where relevant, language courses to ensure that the training is in line with the career opportunities offered following the fellowship. These opportunities must include concrete and attractive long-term career prospects, such as pathways towards open-ended contracts, which can be subject to assessment and evaluation. There must be a fair, equal, inclusive, transparent, structured career accession and progression system providing access to these opportunities in line with the Council Recommendation of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe, the European Charter for Researchers in its annex and the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment.\nA Career Development Plan must be maintained throughout the period of the Choose Europe for Science programme. In addition to research objectives, this Plan comprises the researcher's career development needs, including training on languages, transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events. The Plan should outline the projected career progression paths in the host institution.\n[1] Council Recommendation of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe\n[2] agreement_final.pdf (coara.eu)\n[3] EURAXESS | [Council Recommendation of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:C_202301640) [agreement_final.pdf (coara.eu)](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf) [EURAXESS |](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:\nDevelopment of next generation low-cost batteries for improving the affordability of electric mobility, enhancing the competitiveness of the European battery value chain, while lowering the share of Critical Raw Materials (CRM)[1];\nImproved adaptation and flexibility of advanced and sustainable production processes in European battery manufacturing;\nImproved adaptation/flexibility of design-to-circularity strategies.\nScope:\nProposals are expected to target technologies for design-to-cost batteries, with little reliance on CRMs, from one of the following two main technologies:\nLiquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries with lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) or manganese-rich HLM (high lithium, manganese) as cathode materials (design-to-cost lithium-ion batteries for mobility[2]);\nSodium-ion batteries for mobility applications.\nThe projects are expected to demonstrate, at the end of the project, the following:\nFor HLM and LMFP chemistries, at the cell level:\nGravimetric energy density and volumetric energy density of at least 220 Wh/kg (for LMFP) and 250 Wh/kg (for HLM) and 550 Wh/L (for both) at operational temperature, respectively;\nCharging duration of 20 minutes (20-80% SoC);\nCycle life of >4000 cycles for LMFP and >1500 cycles for HLM at 80% depth of discharge;\nElectric Vehicle (EV) grade cell format and capacity;\nA feasible pathway towards a competitive cost of 50-75€/kWh at pack level by 2030.\nFor sodium-ion batteries at cell level:\nGravimetric energy density and volumetric energy density of 180-200 Wh/kg and 400+ Wh/L at operational temperature, respectively;\nCycle life of 4000-6000 cycles at 80% depth of discharge;\nCharging duration of 20 minutes (20-80% SoC);\nEV grade cell format and capacity;\nA credible pathway towards a competitive cost level of 50-75€/kWh at pack level by 2030.\nProjects are expected to demonstrate the production of cell prototypes at pilot level and feasibility of compatibility (or improvement) of the developed materials with regards to at least one of the following cell production processes:\nDry or aqueous processing technologies;\nAdvanced electrode drying processes;\nImproved cell formation processes and aging protocols;\nImproved energy efficiency of processes in dry rooms.\nProposals are expected to provide the corresponding state-of-the-art benchmark for the selected production process and compare the project’s compatibility or improvement targets to said benchmark.\nFurthermore, projects are expected to demonstrate the feasibility of compatibility (or improvement) of the developed materials with regards to at least one of the following:\nDesign for sorting, dismantling, separation, cost-effective repairing/regeneration, and safe recycling (including direct recycling);\nAdapting Sensing solutions to improve lifetime and state of health detection;\nQuantification of degradation mechanisms at early stage to determine the best strategy for beyond the first life.\nThe Commission initiative for Safe and Sustainable by Design[3] (SSbD) sets a framework for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials which should be considered as a reference for project proposals.\nWhenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).\nProposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)[4] whose contribution could consist in providing added value regarding integral evaluation of safety of materials. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal, or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu)\nJRC shall assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic-specific FAQs under the Funding and Tenders Portal).\nProjects are expected to collaborate and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action defined under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-D2-02-06.\nTo strengthen the European battery ecosystem, projects are expected to use materials, products and equipment produced in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe, unless it is demonstrated that no valid option exists. The procurement strategies should be described in the proposal, especially and to the furthest extent possible the place of production of the elements.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\n[1] Regulation - EU - 2024/1252 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)\n[2] https://bepassociation.eu/our-work/sria/\n[3] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/chemicals-and-advanced-materials_en\n[4] https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/laboratories-z/battery-energy-storage-testing_en [Regulation - EU - 2024/1252 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401252) [https://bepassociation.eu/our-work/sria/](https://bepassociation.eu/our-work/sria/) [https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/chemicals-and-advanced-materials_en](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/chemicals-and-advanced-materials_en) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nSocietal Readiness (SR) is an indicator of R&I results, expressing they have accounted for different societal needs and concerns, thereby increasing their potential for societal uptake.\nThe project is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:\nThe European Commission has a comprehensive overview on the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in piloted projects, and main challenges and concerns are identified;\nA proven strategy to intensify collaboration between STEM[1] and SSH[2] partners led to in-depth interdisciplinary work in R&I projects. All involved project constituencies and relevant parts of society are accounted for in an integrated way to ensure broad and sustainable support for R&I solutions;\nThe next generation of Societal Readiness projects benefits from current pilot projects’ experiences, success stories and do’s and don’ts thanks to a public web platform, acting as a one-stop-shop for Societal Readiness for future EU projects;\nThe European Commission is equipped with a sound, clear, and replicable procedure – both at implementation and content level – presented as an improvement of the current approach, to address Societal Readiness effectively in future EU funded R&I projects.\nScope:\nThe European Commission has a strong interest in learning from the implementation of Societal Readiness actions piloted in eight topics from the Cluster 5 work programme 2025[3], and resulting in an estimate of eighteen projects to be implemented. Conclusions on the pilot’s monitoring and evaluation will be the basis for the European Commission’s decision to replicate further these actions, to improve its implementation and possibly widen its use to other fields of application.\nThe instructions and definitions applying to pilot topics are included in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility.\nThe action is expected to analyse the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in piloted projects and help in designing an efficient, clear, and impactful way of applying a Societal Readiness approach in future EU funded R&I projects with a true interdisciplinary collaboration.\nThe project selected should address all of the following actions:\nMake a consolidated analysis:\non the way Societal Readiness is considered and integrated in the Descriptions of the Actions[4] of selected pilot-projects in terms of content (e.g., the type of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) guiding questions chosen and related methodology), implementation (e.g., SR related work distribution and partners) and methodology. Assess the level, timing, and quality of interactions between SSH and STEM partners during the proposal preparation.\nof all First reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the way SR consideration unfolds from the Description of the Actions’ methodology, observe how guiding questions are addressed and plan to respond to the concerns identified. Compare the various ‘SR visions’ put forward by each consortium.\nof all Final reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the various projects’ experiences, challenges and lessons learned during the actual implementation of the Societal Readiness activities, looking at the participation and type of external actors in co-design methods, responses to SR guiding questions, possible adjustment of R&I activities.\nMid-project recommendations based on the two first points are expected in order to give a preliminary sense of directionality for future Societal Readiness projects.\nAnalyse the various interdisciplinarity mechanisms (SSH vs. STEM, collaboration with societal stakeholders) across pilot-projects as well as their effectiveness in practice. Identify successful interdisciplinary approaches and less successful ones. Possible evolutions in partners behaviours, or changes in interdisciplinary strategies should be identified. The degree of involvement from partners in SR activities, as well as the way they perceive them (in a positive or negative way) should also be scrutinised. This analysis should result in a publication with concrete tips helping future project partners integrating implementable, efficient, and well-accepted interdisciplinary practices both within consortia and towards external actors.\nOrganise annual workshops in physical format to allow all pilot project representatives to meet, interact and exchange experiences periodically. Travel costs for all participants are to be covered by this action.\nSet up a public web platform during the action duration, to provide a direct source of support to future SR users, including examples of SR pathways, do’s and don’ts, tips and tricks specifically tailored to facilitate the use and understanding of the European Commission’s approach on Societal Readiness. A survey submitted beforehand to pilot-projects partners could be envisaged to help in defining those needs. The platform should be updated and completed on a regular basis.\nEventually provide a set of recommendations to the European Commission taking stock of the work achieved as well as of the recommendations elaborated by pilot-projects in their Final reports on Societal Readiness. Practical improvements of the current Societal Readiness approach should be proposed to overcome identified shortcomings, while at the same time, acknowledging the successful aspects of the current approach. The overall Societal Readiness vision[5] should be kept in mind when providing those recommendations, while aiming at keeping a lowest level of implementation complexity, a highest degree of understandability (including for non-SSH experts) and replicability to various technology maturities and fields of applications, as well as a strong interdisciplinary component.\nAn analysis of the added value of SR pilot topics compared to SSH-flagged-only-topics within Cluster 5 as well as of other relevant Societal Readiness routes (e.g. at national level) applied to R&I projects in the area of Climate, Energy and/or Mobility should be performed. Successful practices identified may complement recommendations to be provided to the Commission.\nInformation on e.g. on perceptions, feelings, concerns, past experiences on ways of working that is not translated into projects’ documents should be collected via direct interactions (bilateral discussions with respective project partners).\nThe action should also initiate similar monitoring activities on Societal Readiness pilot projects funded under future Horizon Europe work programmes, whenever operational phases of this action and new pilot projects overlap.\nA duration of 42 months is recommended for this action.\nThe proposed action requires the effective contribution of relevant SSH disciplines including the involvement of SSH experts to proficiently support the monitoring and evaluation of Societal Readiness pilot-projects in Cluster 5 work programme 2025.\n[1] Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics\n[2] Social Sciences and Humanities\n[3] HORIZON-CL5-2025-03-D1-06; HORIZON-CL5-2025-02-D3-04; HORIZON-CL5-2026-02-D4-02; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-01; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-01; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-02; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-11; HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D6-12\n[4] A declaration of confidentiality will be signed by the CSA\n[5] Societal Readiness is an indication of R&I results, expressing they have accounted for different societal needs and concerns, thereby increasing its potential for societal uptake and transition towards societal adaptation.

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\nImproved (compared to the current figures for the locations selected for the pilot testing) road safety (actual and perceived) for pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility devices, considering that the safety of these users is not only at risk from motorised vehicles, but also from their interaction with road users with higher masses or operating speeds (e.g. between e-bikes and pedestrians);\nAn in-depth analysis and assessment of the safety associated with the emergence of electrically assisted small vehicles such e-bikes, e-cargo bikes, e-scooters, to be referred to as micromobility modes, that may be shared or own, and are used for personal mobility (e.g. commuting) and the transportation of goods (e.g. parcel delivery);\nIncreased (compared to the current figures for the locations selected for the pilot testing) use of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups as a result of improved safety;\nStandardisation guidelines for the authorities (cities authorities, police, and hospitals) on how to report crashes that involve micromobility modes with the objective to avoid under- and/or misreporting;\nGuidelines for the city authorities on how to incorporate micromobility modes in their Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) and account for the safety and convenience of all road users;\nDevelopment of mitigating solutions for the adverse impact on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians, and other users of the changing car fleet towards bigger and heavier vehicles;\nIn depth analysis of the impact of road infrastructure (e.g. design, markings, degradation status, quality, network connectivity) on the safety and comfort of cyclists, pedestrians, and micromobility users and development of mitigation solutions;\nAssessment methodologies to evaluate the safety potential and the effectiveness of advanced safety measures.\nScope:\nThe share of trips made by active modes is increasing, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This increase is linked to cities actively placing more focus on the mobility and safety needs of pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility device, which materialises in new regulations, and in new or improved infrastructure. However, pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities.\nProposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects:\nCollect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions;\nProvide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users;\nAssess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased in size and weight;\nQuantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles;\nAssess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles;\nIdentify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development of a draft European regulatory framework on the type-approval of micromobility vehicles or self-certification based on harmonised standards;\nIdentify, define and pilot test the following in at least two clearly identified real-life urban environments:\nnew geometric designs of infrastructure to ensure safe, seamless, and comfortable mobility for pedestrians, cyclists and users of micromobility modes while accounting for the increasing demand, higher operating speeds and weight and size of e-bikes, e-scooters and all types of micromobility devices;\nsmart technologies (V2X) to assess their effectiveness in preventing and decreasing conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, micromobility modes users and motorised traffic;\nroad safety requisites, requirements, rules and/or regulations that could be put in place by local authorities in order to increase the take-up and the safety of active and micromobility modes in all age and socioeconomic groups, by 20% compared to the baseline at the start of the project;\ndevelopment of a comprehensive, real-time information platform for cyclists that includes data on route accessibility, signage, and infrastructure conditions.\nSpecial focus should be paid to supporting the safety of user groups with particular vulnerability including people with disabilities (physical, mental, cognitive, developmental, intellectual, sensory, etc).\nProposals are invited to explain how the work supports local/regional/national authorities’ efforts to deliver on the objectives of the Vision Zero Strategy, the Strategic Action Plan on Road Safety and the EU Road Safety Policy Framework 2021-2030 as well as on the integration of road safety policies and programmes in Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning.\nProposals should plan for an active collaboration with the well-recognised initiatives in the field of road safety and urban mobility such as the European Road Safety Observatory and the CIVITAS initiative. In addition, proposals should demonstrate that the proposed approaches build upon the results from previous research actions[1] and liaise and collaborate with the projects that will be selected under topic “HORIZON-MISS-2025-06-CIT-CANCER-01: Walking and cycling: increasing their modal share to reap health benefits and emission reductions and integrating active mobility and micro-mobility devices, with smart technologies and infrastructure”.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and institutions, as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities, with a focus on human-technology interaction, responsiveness of safety solutions and how this varies across different population groups, and behavioural norms.\n[1] E.g. https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/861570 and https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723430 projects [https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723430](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723430) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:\nAvailability of validated prototypes of next-generation vehicle and infrastructure-based environment perception technologies for robust, reliable and trustworthy CCAM operations to anticipate and avoid foreseeable risks and unexpected safety-critical situations in complex real-world conditions (e.g., at pedestrian crossings, in construction sites, during interactions with emergency vehicles, etc.);\nUnderstanding the degree (and limits) to which automated CCAM perception systems can anticipate, process, and respond to on-site ‘early-warnings’ (e.g., street design, sounds, smells and other signals from the environment, weather conditions, intentions of pedestrians, cyclists, and other active mobility users, etc.);\nImprovement of the energy-efficiency of the sense-think-act systems of CCAM considering the vehicle, the infrastructure, the cloud at-the-edge, while at the same time increasing the performance to guarantee security and error-free reliability; these developments will contribute to the reduction of the potential climate and environmental footprints of CCAM systems;\nStandardisation and adoption of modular, reusable, and upgradable software and hardware platforms, investigating scalable deployment concepts that lead to cost reduction and improved affordability while adopting a circular, eco-design approach (including efficient materials use, reduced waste, and the repair and reuse of components where feasible).\nScope:\nThe initial deployment of Level 4 automated vehicle services in urban and other complex settings has encountered significant challenges in environmental perception and decision-making, leading to occasional remote assistance calls, blockages and accidents that have impacted public trust. At the same time, the increasing computing power demand is in conflict with a limited usage of energy and resources to meet sustainability requirements. Thus, emerging large-scale demonstrations of automated vehicles should be accompanied by objective-oriented research aimed at addressing these challenges directly, while targeting improvements in performance, accuracy, reliability, and cyber-security.\nTo successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:\nAdvancements in all steps of the sense-control-act process for both vehicle- and infrastructure-based smart sensor systems and networks, controllers, and actuators to ensure safety and trustworthiness of CCAM, as well as facilitating effective disruption management;\nUtilisation of digital enabling technologies including, for example: AI at-the-edge, machine learning, data spaces with reference scenarios and suitable software architectures[1];\nAdoption of modular, reusable, and open software platforms supporting the environment perception for CCAM while ensuring transparency of operation, verification, and safety assessment to build trust, with respect to authorities, decision makers and the public via direct performance explainability;\nEnergy efficiency, circularity, and eco-design of the environment perception systems by decreasing potential energy and resource consumption in both production and operation as well as facilitating reusability, reparability and upgradability while further enhancing the performance;\nReduction of potential costs of environment perception systems through scalability, modularity and standardisation, making technologies financially viable for widespread implementation;\nSupport remote assistance as a stepping-stone towards higher levels of autonomy and vehicle automation in wider Operational Design Domains (ODD).\nSolutions are expected to integrate electronic hardware architectures and software stacks in a co-design approach. Hence, it is strongly encouraged that solutions use, as far as possible, building blocks and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative under the Chips Joint Undertaking, e.g., on the hardware abstraction layer and SDV middleware and API framework. Results from projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-04[2] and complementarities with projects funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” should also be considered, where appropriate.\nAs the activities should demonstrate feasibility and their full potential for real-world applications, proposals should foresee exchanges with other relevant EU or national projects for e.g., coordinated validation, transport systems integration and large-scale piloting. Collaboration should also be sought with projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-01[3] and other directly relevant call topics.\nIn view of the relevance of environment perception and decision-making of automated vehicles for the responsiveness of the innovation to diverse societal interests and concerns, accessibility, inclusiveness as well as regulation, proposals should consider societal, ethical, socio-economical and/ or legal aspects as far as feasible in the requirements of the technical solutions to be developed. This could involve the engagement of institutional users as well as citizen-science approaches, e.g., in collaboration with projects CulturalRoad[4] and Diversify – CCAM[5].\nTo achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is highly relevant, considering the lessons learned in this area (for example, from robo-taxi and freight transport trials in the US and China). Activities should foster links between the European ecosystem and relevant stakeholders around the world, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries, while taking into account the legal, cultural, historical, and social aspects in Europe as well as other specificities of the European road network and cities (including: traffic rules, user behaviour, diverse user groups considering gender, age, disability, socio-economic status, streets morphology, and the structure and condition of roads in rural areas).\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM[6].\n[1] In line with the European Artificial Intelligence strategy and requirements for trustworthy, explainable, and safe AI.\n[2] AI for advanced and collective perception and decision making for CCAM applications\n[3] Centralised, reliable, cyber-secure & upgradable in-vehicle electronic control architectures for CCAM connected to the cloud-edge continuum.\n[4] Cocreate, Embrace – grant agreement ID: 101147397.\n[5] Diversify CCAM by integrating European cultural and regional variations in the design and implementation of citizen-friendly systems to foster mobility equity - grant agreement id: 101147484.\n[6] See the evaluation methodology here.

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nOverview of CCAM-specific limitations of current data exchange solutions and existing dataspaces related to interfaces, harmonised ontologies and taxonomies, standards, formats, monetisation / compensation;\nMapping of information and reference data needs for KPIs collected by Member States and Associated Countries (where relevant and to the extent possible), related to impacts of CCAM technologies and solutions;\nFederated sustainable CCAM Data Exchange Platform that facilitates sharing of data for both large-scale demonstrations and deployment, interfacing existing data spaces and improving the exchange, availability, and accessibility of data for the development, testing and deployment of CCAM services (including but not limited to Digital Twins, digital scenario representations, safety assurance and validation, ADS regulation monitoring, driver behaviour, AI model training, and the collection of national/EU level statistics and Key Performance Indicators);\nProposed governance structure for the Data Exchange Platform with a sustainability plan and viable business model.\nScope:\nData sharing plays a pivotal role in supporting R&I, enabling deployment, and enhancing the competitiveness of the CCAM industry. Within the realm of data sharing, there are two distinct categories of data that are particularly pertinent: mobility data, and data for research and development. The common European mobility data space[1] aims to facilitate mobility data access and sharing, and is supported by projects, notably from the Digital Europe Programme. This mobility data space will facilitate the sharing of data related to mobility patterns, traffic flow, and other macroscopic aspects that are essential for the development of CCAM solutions. Within the research, testing and deployment of CCAM solutions for the automotive as well as infrastructure sectors, there is a need for a dedicated data space tailored specifically to the requirements of CCAM stakeholders. This CCAM Data Space demands a more granular and extensive array of data to cater to the needs of both Tier X suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), traffic managers and infrastructure providers, particularly in terms of vehicle and traffic safety considerations. Specific aspects related to ongoing regulatory developments would need to be considered (e.g. Automated Driving Systems and General Safety regulations, adaption of type approval to the AI Act, including trustworthy AI integration).\nSeveral data spaces exist or are being developed in Europe for CCAM in specific R&I initiatives. The FAME[2] project has released a CCAM Data Sharing Framework (DSF) 2.0 describing best practices in data sharing and will develop a CCAM Federated Data Space as a proof of concept to facilitate the exchange of research and test data across R&I projects. Several CCAM Partnership R&I projects expressed interest in making data available and reusing data from other projects through the FAME Test Data Space, once it will be operational. The scenario-based validation approach for safety argumentation in highly automated functions will result in an integration of various scenario databases facilitated by a federated layer, as developed in project SUNRISE[3] and SYNERGIES[4]. However, this integration falls short of constituting a comprehensive Data Space approach, both for new data sets and extensions of existing datasets. To achieve full Data Space functionality for CCAM, significant enhancements are required in terms of developing connectors, APIs, and protocols for seamless data exchange. Additionally, there is a need to refine user profile management systems and establish robust contractual frameworks to govern data access and usage rights. A generic data space blueprint and building blocks are being developed and governed by the Data Space Support Centre[5]. In parallel, the DeployEMDS[6] builds a decentralised technical infrastructure and common governance mechanisms for urban mobility use cases in 9 cities and regions across Europe.\nConsequently, substantial efforts are necessary to fully integrate these approaches into a cohesive and efficient Data Space environment that can effectively support the diverse needs of the CCAM research community and industry. Moreover, extensive datasets are also indispensable for the development of low-level modules such as driver monitoring systems, perception systems, and decision-making algorithms, as well as for sensors like GNSS, radar, cameras, and lidar. While projects like AIthena[7] and AWARE2ALL[8] have generated valuable datasets, the lack of centralised storage and access hampers their utility. Therefore, there is a strong need to incorporate such datasets into a unified CCAM Data Space that is aligned with the data space blueprint, taking advantage of the common building blocks.\nBy establishing robust interfaces, ontologies, and data management architectures, the CCAM research community and industry can effectively utilise and repurpose existing data, thereby reducing costs, and facilitating the development and validation of CCAM solutions, including the creation of digital twins through synthetic data. The enhanced sharing of data across the CCAM stakeholders should also benefit national authorities, and operators in their efforts to collect KPIs to monitor wider impacts of CCAM solutions including on safety, economy, and society.\nProposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:\nIdentify how to further evolve the data spaces for CCAM applications, connecting existing dataspaces and bridging data gaps;\nIdentify harmonisation and standardisation needs for taxonomies, interfaces, and data formats to push CCAM data exchange and extend and implement the CCAM taxonomies in the CCAM Test Data Space;\nIdentify information needs and reference data for KPIs collected from Member States and Associated Countries (where relevant and to the extent possible) of i.e. high-level socio-economic statistics, accidents, infrastructure, vehicles;\nEstablish a Federated CCAM Data Exchange Platform with tools and governance, including a viable business model to ensure the durability of the platform, which facilitates sharing of data for industry, social partners, authorities and academia that are supporting specific use cases related to: large-scale demonstrations, generation and maintenance of digital twins and representation of scenarios (for development or validation), performance and safety assessment, driver behaviour data from real and synthetic driving conditions, ADS regulation monitoring, AI model training, and common information source for national/EU level statistics and Key Performance Indicators;\nIdentify and describe methods/algorithms/processes to refine and use data for the specific use cases tackled by the Platform;\nIdentify the effects of the EU General Data Protection Legislation (GDPR) on AI learning workflows and possible mitigation measures.\nA strong alignment with the common European mobility data space and related projects[9] is expected. The work should ensure coherence and interoperability with other common European data spaces, especially regarding its cross-sectoral blueprint and building blocks, by aligning with the Data Spaces Support Centre and by using, as far as possible, the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl[10]. The work should build on the outcomes of the FAME project and the FAME Test Data Space (Data Sharing - Connected Automated Driving). Finally, links with related activities under the future European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC) for Mobility and Logistics Data and cooperation with the CCAM Partnership’s States Representative Group (SRG) is expected. Particular attention should be dedicated towards establishing interoperability standards for data sharing within and across data ecosystems, through the implementation of the FAIR data principles and leveraging already adopted practices, especially in relevant European common data spaces.\nIn order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM[11].\n[1] Creating a common European mobility data space - European Commission (europa.eu)\n[2] Framework for coordination of Automated Mobility in Europe, grant agreement ID: 101069898.\n[3] Safety assUraNce fRamework for connected, automated mobIlity SystEms, grant agreement ID: 101069573.\n[4] Real and synthetic scenarios generated for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems, grant agreement ID: 101146542.\n[5] Data Spaces Blueprint\n[6] See for more information: https://deployemds.eu/\n[7] AI-based CCAM: Trustworthy, Explainable, and Accountable, grant agreement ID: 101076754.\n[8] Safety systems and human-machine interfaces oriented to diverse population towards future scenarios with increasing share of highly automated vehicles, grant agreement ID: 101076868.\n[9] The awarded proposal should build on the outcomes of the preparatory action PrepDSpace4Mobility and the EMDS study under CEF.

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nValidated human behavioural models representing the variety of human driving behaviour in safety-relevant scenarios, shared through a common repository and to be used:\nto define pass criteria/ assessment criteria for CCAM systems in type approval schemes, consumer testing campaigns and industrial development processes;\nto design safe, human-like behaviour of CCAM systems that can be anticipated easily by all road users and is acceptable to both CCAM vehicle occupants and all road users.\nApplication of such human behavioural models in the virtual safety validation of CCAM systems to realistically represent the behaviour of human-driven vehicles in closed loop simulations of mixed traffic, thereby reflecting the variety of human driving behaviour, including behaviour in complex real-world and emergency conditions.\nScope:\nThe deployment of CCAM systems in mixed traffic will mean intense interaction with all road users such as the human drivers of other vehicles as well as pedestrians and riders of two-wheelers. These interactions (including implicit and explicit communication by humans and CCAM systems) will play a crucial role in the acceptance and thereby the penetration of CCAM systems in future road transport. CCAM systems will have to show safe and human-like driving behaviour, so that their decisions and actions can be anticipated easily by all road users, respecting the variety of typical driving behaviour across different countries as well as the need for CCAM systems to respect traffic rules and support road safety.\nThis will require validated models of explicit and implicit human driving behaviour to design and validate such system behaviour. These models will be needed in closed loop simulations of CCAM systems in mixed traffic to realistically represent the reactions of human drivers in other vehicles to the behaviour of a CCAM system. Models representing human driving behaviour are being developed by the projects i4Driving[1] and BERTHA[2] for selected fields of application, i.e. they will be calibrated for a limited number of scenarios. Bringing together and building upon the results of these projects – in particular a simulation library and an innovative methodology to account for uncertainty from i4Driving and a scalable, probabilistic driver behavioural model from BERTHA, research is needed to extend the fields of application that these projects are addressing with a focus on representing driver behaviour in a multitude of safety-critical scenarios, considering the variation and statistical distribution of human behavioural patterns and the factors influencing such behaviour, including the parallel execution of non-driving related tasks.\nTo achieve high degrees of robustness and applicability in a wide range of scenarios, detailed calibration and parameterisation is necessary, as driver behaviour depends on factors such as the road infrastructure, vehicle types, traffic conditions and rules, as well as regional influences and driver experiences / demographics, e.g., gender, age and other relevant social variables. Considering the deviation of average from ideal human driving behaviour, proposed actions must also validate the models for their extended fields of application, going well beyond the applications and degrees of validation accomplished by the above-mentioned projects under HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-03. Proposed actions are thus expected to raise the technology readiness of such models to TRL 5. Data for parameterisation and validation should be captured by monitoring real human drivers in driving simulators and/or real traffic considering what is happening inside and outside the vehicle.\nProposed actions should integrate, to the extent possible, the validated models in the virtual validation and verification approaches as developed in the projects HEADSTART[3] and SUNRISE[4] and complemented by the project SYNERGIES[5]. Successful integration should be demonstrated in various safety-relevant scenarios as provided by the action(s) funded under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02[6]. Models should be shared via the federated data exchange platform for CCAM to be developed by an action under HORIZON-CL5-2025-D6-06[7].\nProposals are encouraged to also explore additional fields of application of validated driver behaviour models, while the integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and humanities (SSH) is expected.\nTo achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged with research stakeholders in Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies as far as possible in capturing data for the parametrisation and validation of behavioural models, while considering regional and cultural differences as well as specificities of respective road infrastructures.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM[8].\nProjects funded under this topic are encouraged to explore potential complementarities with the activities of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre’s Sustainable, Smart, and Safe Mobility Unit and, where appropriate, establish formal collaboration.\n[1] Integrated 4D driver modelling under uncertainty, grant agreement ID: 101076165.\n[2] BEhavioural ReplicaTion of Human drivers for CCAM, grant agreement ID: 101076360.\n[3] Harmonised European solutions for testing automated road transport, grant agreement id: 824309.\n[4] Safety assUraNce fRamework for connected, automated mobIlity SystEms, grant agreement ID: 101069573.\n[5] Real and synthetic scenarios generated for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems, grant agreement ID: 101146542.\n[6] Generation of scenarios for development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems\n[7] Federated CCAM data exchange platform (see below).\n[8] See the evaluation methodology here.

            "Expected Outcome:\nTo support the Zero Pollution Action Plan and the Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy as well as the implementation of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nReal-time demonstration of on-board tamper-proof and remote measurement techniques for a wide range of pollutants (including pollutants from alternative fuels and non-regulated pollutants) from vessel emissions, allowing shipowners to measure the emissions during operation and contributing to the current monitoring and enforcing activities of public authorities, such as port and maritime authorities and with the potential to be used for future compliance monitoring;\nDevelopment of broadly accepted harmonised methods to measure real sailing emissions, including coastal, open seas and inland waterway with potential to be used for future compliance monitoring;\nDevelopment of an automatic reporting and verification system solution that helps shipping companies to comply with current and future regulation and for maritime, inland and port authorities to monitor and control the actual ship emissions derived from the data exchanged;\nContribution to the delivery of better emission factors for emissions inventories and projections, especially for harmful substances and fuel mixtures for which little knowledge exists today and ultimately contributing to the establishment of a broadly accepted method for measuring and calculating real sailing emissions of a ship;\nIdentification of real-world releases of harmful substances which are currently not controlled by regulations and excessive releases of substances already controlled in open seas and in-port activities;\nInnovative technologies and systems to monitor, measure and identify the source of pollution in ports beyond vessels, including other transport modes, port operations and industries active in the port environment are made available for public authorities;\nRecommendations for improved certification and testing to better cover real world situations;\nSupport of local, regional, national and international emissions reduction and air quality plans and noise action plans by providing real-world emission information and measuring the actual impact of control measures and strategies on concentrations and/or deposition of pollutants;\nIdentification of risk areas for potential violations to emission limits.\nScope:\nThere is a pressing need to measure accurately the different types of emissions in coastal and port environments located near to cities, because of their negative impact on the environment and human health. Ports, as intricate environments showcasing a variety of vessels including novel designs, pose a challenge to the development of standardised technologies capable of collecting and assessing real-time pollutant emissions data from these ships docking at ports. This is vital for enforcing emissions limits and validating the data for enforcement purposes.\nMoreover, emissions in ports stem from other sources, such as port operations (e.g., cargo handling, towing, fuel storage, and bunkering) or even other industrial activities (directly or indirectly linked to transport, e.g., fisheries) taking place within the port area. Additionally, ports are frequently situated near industrial zones, making it crucial to possess an accurate and, where possible, real-time understanding of the types, origins, and intensity of pollutant and noise emissions generated in and around a port area.\nThe shift from heavy fuel oils to alternative fuels in the context of the regulatory framework[1] set to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal requires further research actions; recent evidence from research and monitoring projects has shown that new fuels being considered and GHG emission-control technologies used on-board vessels may result in emissions of other harmful pollutants that are not sufficiently controlled. In some cases, unexpected side effects of emission abatement may arise which might require regulatory action[2].\nFurther to such undesired releases, it is crucial to ensure that vessels comply with regulations in force, in coastal areas, at open sea and in inland waterways. Projects under call LC-MG-1-1-2018 of Horizon 2020 showed that remote measurement of SOx emissions using stationary or mobile techniques can significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of compliance monitoring. It is important to explore whether remote or on-board techniques can be extended to the monitoring of additional pollutants such as CH4, NOx, N2O, NH3, UFP, BC, formaldehyde, PM[3], as well as the Particle Number (PN), NPAHs and to provide internationally harmonised methods and reporting procedures where such measurements can be used within an enhanced compliance monitoring framework in the future. These methods should also have the potential to be used as evidence for law enforcement to enable independent prosecution of violations. Furthermore, there is a need to develop engine testing procedures that better represent operational patterns in order for the emission values from test cycles to accurately represent real emissions.\nLimited surveillance measurements at open seas show a different compliance (lower compliance) behaviour for sulphur emissions compared to measurements in coastal regions. Therefore, it is important to identify risk areas for violations and to establish techniques for monitoring in these areas as well. It is of equally great importance to develop harmonised/standardised monitoring methods that could be used as evidence for sanctions in the future.\nAssessment of the real-world performance of emission control, in particular for Tier III vessels, is therefore required to make sure that current NOx regulations achieve and sustain the emission reductions that these regulations are designed for. Further, certification testing should be modified to better address real world conditions. Moreover, potential ammonia slip from urea consumption needs to be identified, and N2O emission levels need to be determined to ensure that GHG reduction efforts are not thwarted.\nIn addition, no established method for identifying NOx emissions that exceed existing standards under real sailing operation is currently in place. Based on different remote or on-board measurement techniques, harmonised methods, and reporting procedures to identify exceedances of expected emission levels needs to be designed and put in action, at least for informative reasons – as no enforcement of low NOx under real operation is currently in place.\nWith CH4 being a potent GHG, any uncontrolled releases from LNG powered vessels significantly compromise any lower carbon benefits of the LNG as a fuel. Moreover, although boil-off gas (BOG) should be reliquefied or used on-board, records of BOG release to the atmosphere have been reported. The extent of any remaining current problem needs to be identified and measurements on methane slip from actual vessels need to identify the extent of emissions, considering potential needs for methane emission limits (for the engines as well as for the fuel storage onboard and the bunkering process). The problem with methane slip will also remain with the use of bio-methane as fuel.\nNew fuels are considered in the effort to decarbonise shipping, with the most prominent being ammonia (NH3), methanol (MeOH) and hydrogen. There is currently limited evidence on new pollution dimensions induced by such fuels, including ultrafine particles of non-carbonaceous origin, N2O and NH3 emissions, NPAH, Formaldehyde PM, NOx, etc. Measurements on actual marine engines and vessels using such fuels need to provide new evidence in the pool of data forming so that early measures are taken before such new fuels become widespread in actual use, in case such new emissions prove to be at a level that constitute health hazards or environmental risks. Zero carbon fuels like NH3 and H2, as well as dual-fuel engines and CO2 capture onboard require different remote measurement methods, since CO2 is no longer a stable and dominant reference gas in the exhaust plume. Alternative options in sensing and calculation method need to be introduced.\nDemonstration must be undertaken within a real operational environment. In the collection and analysis of remote as well as static sensing data for the monitoring of emissions and air pollutants, the accuracy of the sensors and the quality and verifiability of the data obtained are of particular importance. Potential risks and problems in data collection and sensor technology, in particular as regards the identification of the source of the pollution, should be analysed in detail. A verifiable methodology is also required for processing and interpreting the data in the next step. Issues such as access to data, data storage and associated security aspects (including the assessment of cyber security of interoperable systems) should be fully considered. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR[4].\nTo address all these highlighted issues, proposals are expected to undertake all the following R&I activities:\nMap high emission activities and demonstrate port, coastal, inland and open sea monitoring techniques for at least NOx, BC, N2O, UFP, NH3, CH4,, PM as well as PN and NMVOC (or any other related pollutants), during normal operation of ships which includes dynamic engine loads of all ship types (including port service vessels) and suitable for zero carbon fuels, dual-fuel engines and carbon capture. All the emission measurements should be integrated through static and remote sensing in order to share data;\nDemonstration of the developed measuring technologies in 6 different TEN-T ports, (of which 3 Core and 3 Comprehensive ports, covering at least three sea basins of the Black, Mediterranean, North Sea, N. Atlantic and Baltic Seas). Out of these 6 ports at least one should be classified as a TEN-T inland-waterway only port according to Annex II of the TEN-T Regulation. At least one of the ports should be situated in a city participating in the Cities Mission and activities should feed into the implementation of the Climate City Contract (CCC), with abatement measures and port-city collaborative governance approaches to match or enhance CCC commitments. The selection of ports should be such as to cover a wide range of emission profiles and take into consideration the complexity of emission sources in order to ensure that the outcome is representative and can be replicated to other ports;\nIdentify, differentiate and measure in real time at or near possible sources of emissions (e.g., individual vessel, specific port operations, industrial installations within and very close to the port area) under complex (geographical, layout, mixed space uses and other) conditions and variable weather conditions. The calibration of the measurement systems and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated;\nDevelopment of a methodology for assessing pollution within the port area including emissions from all transport modes, port operations and industries located in the port area;\nIdentify the impact of emissions in ports and nearby cities and propose mitigating measures and plans for municipalities and port authorities, including ports in which municipalities are not directly involved in the management of port authorities and terminals;\nDevelopment of Real-Time Decision Support Systems (RT DSS) for ships, onboard ship operations, ship operators to look into data collected to enable port and maritime authorities to make decisions about rebates;\nDevelopment of harmonised monitoring techniques and an automatic reporting and verification system solution helping shipowners to comply with current and future EU and international regulation as well as public authorities to monitor and control emissions from the data exchanged;\nHarmonise/standardise monitoring techniques and reporting (taking also into consideration the CountEmissions EU rules) with the potential to be used for legal prosecution; develop recommendations for improved certification and testing for real world situations;\nIncrease evidence to feed pool of data for regulated and non-regulated pollutants from vessels;\nIdentify pollutants from new fuels used for shipping decarbonisation;\nDevelop protocol(s) for the measurement of BC, UFP, and PN from vessels;\nDevelop engine testing methods to better mimic real-world emissions and propose a vessel grading system methodology with respect to its emissions comparable to EURO classification of road vehicles.\nProposals should demonstrate how they will engage with authorities and local communities in disseminating results in proportion to their expected impacts. Relevant authorities include the European Commission, the Bonn Agreement, Helcom, the IMO, and national, regional, and local competent authorities etc. while local communities are primarily, but not limited to, major port cities and coastal areas in the EU.\nProposals are encouraged to explore and use the results from previous EU-funded projects such as SCIPPER (Horizon 2020), EMERGE (Horizon 2020) and Green C Ports (CEF), Interreg Clean North Sea Shipping and LIFE CLINSH (CLean Inland SHipping) as well as develop complementarities with relevant activities funded under the Horizon Europe call on “Advanced transport emissions monitoring networks” (HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-18) and activities developing satellite-based measurements (Cluster 4 Destination 5 (Space) and EUSPA), focusing on remaining gaps not covered by these projects. Duplication of activities should be avoided.\nProposals are encouraged to include and consider the fisheries sectors and fishing vessels, considering their potential intersections with the use of alternative fuels in ports when relevant. Consideration of projects such as HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-05 and PPPA-2024-FISHVESSELDEMO may prove beneficial.\nThe funded projects should share their experience and good practices with the projects selected under the topic of the EU Ocean & Waters Mission on “Restoring waterfront cities and their ports /maritime infrastructures (HORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-05) and links should also be established with the projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL4-SPACE-2025-01-46: Innovative Earth observation services in support of maritime litter detection and ship source pollution policies.\nThis topic has been co-programmed and is contributing to the implementation of the Zero-Emission Waterborne Transport (ZEWT) partnership and of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission.\n[1] The IMO's 2023 GHG Strategy targets net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by 2050, with interim goals for 2030 and 2040. Measures include the adoption of lower-carbon fuels such as methanol and ammonia. In the EU, initiatives like FuelEU Maritime and ETS inclusion will drive this transition while regulations address harmful emissions like sulphur and nitrogen oxides, with Tier III NOx limits enforced. Discussions also focus on Black Carbon emissions in the Arctic and health impacts of ultrafine particles.\n[2] For example, evidence shows that the introduced Tiers may not be effective in controlling NOx emissions in real vessel operation, scrubbers may result in the formation of new ultra-fine particles, ammonia combustion potentially leads to the formation of nitrous oxide and ammonia slip, methanol combustion may lead to the production of formaldehyde, LNG may result in the slip of methane, etc. Obviously, any strategy targeting the control of GHG or air pollutants should not result in negative side-effects such as the release of harmful pollutants which are today not covered by regulations.\n[3] CH4 – methane; NOx - nitrogen oxides; N20 – nitrous oxide; UFP – ultra-fine particles; BC – black carbon; PM – particulate matter.\n[4] Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nThe need to perform research in the field of icing, to ensuring safety and efficiency of proposed new solutions (TRL 3-5), is justified by the increasing incidence of weather hazards caused by climate change, the new generation of low carbon dioxide (CO2) aircraft with associated disruptive configurations, and the stringency of new policies and certification rules.\nIn the mid-term, project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:\nGenerating scientific expertise to develop means of compliance for the certification of icing systems;\nGenerating scientific knowledge to be able to develop new prototypes of ice detection and protection.\nScope:\nThe field of aircraft icing is of particular importance because it relates to the safety of flight facing adverse weather conditions, which became increasingly extreme during the last decade.\nThe aviation industry is working to develop clean and sustainable aviation. There is the need to innovate while maintaining safety.\nTo enable design, validation and future certification of new technologies emerging from cleaner aviation, R&I should be initiated on the following three principal areas ( proposals should consider addressing all, or significant areas of all, three areas):\n1. R&I to prepare for the development of means of compliance for certification of future sustainable aviation concepts including:\nDevelopment of reliable numerical tools to be used to validate the designs against the icing environment of Appendix C, O, P and snow, including ground anti-icing fluids;\nDevelopment of Supercooled Large Drop (SLD) Testing Capabilities such as icing wind tunnel test or ice tankers. Generation of flight-testing open datasets for validation of modelling and tunnel testing;\nDevelopment of European Ice Crystal test Capability (for engine/air data probe);\nDevelopment of Falling / Blowing Snow Testing Capability.\n2. R&I on Icing environment to assess the impact of the climate change effects on the certification icing environments[1].\n3. R&I related to new technologies for Ice detection and protection, including:\nIce crystal and SLDs Ice Detection systems to optimise Ice crystals protection or support the detect and exit the SLD appendix O or a portion of the appendix O conditions;\nHigh Efficiency/Low Energy protection: cleaner aviation with more electric airplanes will drive the need for new ice protection technology: more effective and with less energy, active, passive and hybrid technologies (e.g., low ice-adhesion durable coatings and including new air mobility products (e.g., low speed propeller icing concerns);\nDissimilar means for Air data (angle of attack (AOA)/Speed) measurement and insensitive to icing threat. Air speed and aircraft attitude measurements are crucial for aircraft control. Air data/navigation probes are externally mounted and exposed to adverse conditions. Dissimilar means to determine the aircraft speed and altitude would provide benefits and make the air data system even more robust and fault tolerant to environmental conditions (icing or hail);\nEnhanced aircraft performance and in particular ice protection health monitoring by improving the ice protection system monitoring coverage based on smart systems capable to monitor a large number of aircraft parameters.\nThis research and innovation topic is linked to several ongoing rulemaking actions of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency:\nRES.0010 Ice Crystal Detection\nRES.0017 Icing hazard linked to super cooled large droplets (SLD)\nRES.0014 Air-data enhanced fault detection and diagnosis\nRMT.0196 Update of the flight simulation training device requirements\nRMT.0118 Analysis of on-ground wing contamination effect on take-off performance degradation\nA close cooperation with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and with notational aviation authorities during the implementation of this project should be envisioned.\n[1] Note: the project will assess the use of specific models for the prediction of icing conditions (e.g., addressing cloud micro-physics for the formation ice crystals, super cooled water droplets), which can be coupled to climate models (e.g., General Circulation Models).

            "Expected Outcome:\nThe rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the past decade makes it the most promising next generation photovoltaic technology, owing to its prominent advantages such as tuneable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, uncomplicated preparation process and considerable power conversion efficiency which has reached a certified 26.7% at cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light-related stability. All these features render perovskite solar modules suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with a low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). A number of companies are working on PSCs and some of them, have been establishing new pilot production lines and/or expanding production capacity. Still, the greatest challenges toward commercialisation are scaling up (including ambient manufacturing), achieving long-term stability, reducing, or eliminating the use of toxic solvents, and preventing Pb leakage into the environment.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nIncrease the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV creating competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;\nSupport a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components;\nSupport the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda[1].\nScope:\nMetal halide perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention because of their low-cost fabrication and high efficiency. In addition, tandem devices, especially perovskite-Si tandems, are expected to play an important role in perovskite commercialisation. Poor stability of these devices remains however the key challenge in their path toward commercialisation. To overcome this issue, a robust encapsulation technique by employing suitable materials and structures with high barrier performance against the external environment must be developed to protect perovskite devices. Dedicated manufacturing processes and equipment need also be demonstrated. Therefore, proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:\nDemonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices;\nScale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, (overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules;\nDemonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination;\nDevelop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible deterioration of the perovskite materials;\nAssess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem technology.\nDemonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or perovskite-Si tandem) production process.\nProposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one perovskite or equipment manufacturer.\nWhenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\n[1] Commission Staff Working Document \"Solar energy joint research and innovation agenda with Member States in the context of the European Research Area (ERA)\" [Commission Staff Working Document \"Solar energy joint research and innovation agenda with Member States in the context of the European Research Area (ERA)\"](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/3acfa717-b321-4f7d-b8c3-765f507d7de2_en?filename=ec_rtd_swd-2024-160-f1.pdf) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nA quite wide portfolio of technologies, which are close to be deployed but still lack the real-world demonstration of economic viability, exists. Significant volumes of advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) are needed to cover the current fleets and the sectors where renewable fuels are the main long-term solution, such as aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries. Therefore, an exceptional effort is needed to establish more successful projects where full-scale plants are built and operated based on the vast potential of sustainable feedstocks throughout the EU.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nEnergy producers and consumers in transport and energy-intensive industries benefit from the mobilisation of building of industrial capacity for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin;\nTechnology developers benefit from the support to the preparation of first-of-a-kind plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin to become precursors for the following commercial plants;\nTechnology providers benefit from the de-risking of the innovative technologies, reduction of CAPEX and production costs, boosting of scale-up and contribution to market up-take of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin;\nPublic authorities, citizens, researchers, and industrial stakeholders benefit from the improvement of the sustainability, reliability, robustness, and security of the relevant value chain;\nNational authorities profit from the provided evidence for innovative advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin technologies, which can contribute to the Renewable Energy Directive indicative target for innovative renewable energy technology in each Member State of at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, as well as to the targets under ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime.\nPolicy makers and regulators profit from the provided factual information and evidence in view of their decision as regards accelerating permitting procedures, harvesting benefits from multiple uses of land and water and increasing the responsiveness of research and innovation in that field to diverse societal interests and concerns;\nThe implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Action for Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy is supported and facilitated.\nScope:\nDemonstrate innovative large-scale production of liquid advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin for sectors with specific need for such fuels (particularly aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries). Production is expected to be based on various EU sustainable biomass feedstocks, notably biogenic residues and wastes, biogenic part of slurries and industrial wastes, and/or on non-biological origin feedstocks, such as renewable hydrogen and CO2 or renewable carbon, nitrogen, or their compounds, through chemical, biochemical, biological, and thermochemical pathways, or a combination of them. Proposals are expected to:\ndemonstrate large scale production of ready-to-deploy advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin, engaging feedstock developers and suppliers, technology developers, fuel suppliers, end users for purchasing the quantities, national bodies, and public or private authorities with funding capacity;\naddress and assess the impact of actual, real-size feedstocks, (like for example agricultural wastes, energy crops grown on marginal and degraded lands or as intermediate crops, forestry wastes, biogenic municipal and industrial wastes, all types of renewable hydrogen, actual streams of CO2 and nitrogen, available renewable carbon or their compounds), in terms of their constitution on plant design, (e.g. for feedstock pretreatment and wastewater treatment as appropriate);\naddress and assess the impact on plant design and feasibility of improving the feedstocks externally and upstream to the fuel production plant, by increasing the energy density of the feedstocks through for example torrefaction, by homogenisation of feedstocks for making them uniform or similar, and by standardisation of feedstocks, as appropriate.\nProjects should produce a lifetime cycle analysis of their production route and in particular for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, as inputs in terms of renewable energy and material (CO2, nitrogen, renewable hydrogen) may not be continuously available.\nProduction of renewable hydrogen as an end-product is excluded from the scope of this topic.\nThe projects are expected to result in reference cases for ready-to-build, revamp/reuse and/or operate full-scale plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin. Improvements, optimisation, new schemes and modification of existing demonstration plants that can result into the preparation of the next full-scale plant are considered within scope to encourage deployment of cost-effective solutions.\nThe plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong investment and business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plan should include plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment. It is expected to provide information and assessment about the economic viability of the commercial plant, the permitting procedures, a full value chain-based business plan and identified funding sources such as private equity, loans, loans guarantee, grants, or public financing for CAPEX and OPEX, as well as take-off agreements for the fuel uptake. Moreover, they should provide information on, or linked to, the identified funding sources, like private equity, the InvestEU, the EU Catalyst Partnership, the Innovation Fund, and possibly the European Regional Development Fund programmes. Projects are expected to include at least one relevant local economic business case, outlining local value and supply chains and the expected number of local jobs at the place of deployment. Furthermore, proposals are expected to provide information and assessment of impact on land and water use, soil and biodiversity, for example in relation to marginal and degraded land feedstocks, and of public awareness on full-scale renewable fuel plants.\nAn assessment of the sustainability and the GHG reduction from fossil equivalents should be shown based on a life-cycle analysis for the large-scale fuel production. Special attention should be paid to estimating the GHG emissions reduction potential; projects are encouraged to use the methodology in the Innovation Fund. Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nEuropean energy security and industrial competitiveness are contested by the geopolitical circumstances and market situations around the world. Advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin are in EU’s portfolio of technologies that contribute to net-zero manufacturing in Europe. However, remaining challenges impacting the security of supply and competitiveness of these technologies and the integration of their value chains need to be clearly understood, presented, and mitigated.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nEnergy consumers benefit from the contribution to improved EU energy security and industrial competitiveness of renewable fuel technologies;\nEnergy producers and consumers benefit from the improved reliability, robustness and security of renewable fuel technologies (compared to existing ones);\nDiverse stakeholders, e.g., policy makers, public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industry, profit from the enhancement of common knowledge and understanding about existing opportunities of integrated value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin;\nMulti stakeholders, e.g., policy makers, technology developers, researchers, industrial and any other relevant stakeholders to the value chain, profit from the generation of multi benefits of promoting sustainable development and sustainable agriculture regarding climate change resilience and regenerative practices, accelerating renewable fuel innovation, and maximising carbon removals.\nScope:\nProjects are expected to assess the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin, in view of the new situation in the EU regarding energy security and industrial competitiveness with the rest of the word. They are expected to also evaluate how these technologies could contribute to the EU’s energy security and industrial competitiveness through detailed value chain analysis and development of future scenarios, macroeconomic modelling, and strategic decision-making methods. Value chains closer to commercialisation with the potential to contribute more to the EU 2030 targets for green transition and industrial competitiveness and value chains for technologies under development with the potential to contribute to the longer term and could duly adopt mitigation measures, are both in scope. Proposals are expected to identify the research and innovation actions needed to improve the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of these value chains, and implement as appropriate research activities for such optimisation, as well as new standards definitions for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs as appropriate.\nCompetitiveness, energy security and integration challenges of the various steps in a value chain and of the relevant stakeholders are expected to be addressed. Integration aspects encompass every step of each individual value chain and every stakeholder. Proposals are expected to coordinate efforts towards development of win-win integrated solutions of sustainable value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin engaging all relevant stakeholders, including as relevant farmers, CO2 suppliers, technology providers, researchers, fuel producers, end users, policy makers, international organisations. Multidisciplinary issues related to advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin production, carbon removals, CO2 trading and valorisation, sustainable farming, production of nature-based soil amendments, fertilizers, and organic materials, fuel standardisation, trade-off/synergies of carbon farming with in-situ carbon storing and of land uses for fuels versus solar panels for derived fuels, are expected to be considered, to achieve benefits for all through the integration.\nValue chains of renewable hydrogen as an end-product are not within the scope of this topic.\nA sustainability assessment of integrated solutions including techno-economic, environmental and social aspects is expected to be carried out based on life cycle analysis.

A key challenge remains the accelerated uptake of such solutions in building and renovation projects.

In at least two cases, the proposed planning methods and procedures should be relevant for renovation;\nInvestigate the use of innovative tools and methods which facilitate the adaptation of the buildings stock to changing user needs, while positively contributing to occupants’ comfort and health;\nPropose and apply a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the developed pathways for the decarbonisation and climate resilience of buildings and the built environment, including the calculation of their whole life carbon reduction compared to a “business as usual” scenario;\nEnsure the active involvement of all relevant public and private stakeholders of the whole renovation and construction value chain, which must include among others: municipalities, citizens (including vulnerable groups) and civil society organisations and the building and construction sector professions;\nContribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and its network of innovation clusters[2].\nSelected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on innovative building solutions for resource efficiency, safety, durability and adaptability of the building stock, as well as performing experimental research for validating those solutions on full-scale prototype buildings.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise (including social innovation), in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\n[1] “Supporting the development of a roadmap for the reduction of whole life carbon of buildings”, European Union, 2023’.

It is thus the total amount of embodied and operational emissions.”\n[2] https://built4people.eu/nebula_project/ [Supporting the development of a roadmap for the reduction of whole life carbon of buildings](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/923706b7-8f41-11ee-8aa6-01aa75ed71a1/language-en) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nIncreased number of approaches and solutions enabling a net positive yearly energy balance at district level and the export of excess renewable energy to the grid outside its geographical boundaries, with enhanced replicability on a larger scale in other positive energy districts (PEDs) in different contexts;\nMeasurable increase in inclusiveness and public acceptance of the implementation of PEDs;\nImproved user-friendliness and user-awareness of guidelines, tools, and training materials targeting key professionals for overcoming the different types of barriers towards the realisation of PEDs.\nScope:\nRecent projects have demonstrated the feasibility of PEDs, but there is a need to further demonstrate climate-neutral impact, while developing and demonstrating innovative approaches and solutions for overcoming technical, business, social and organisational constraints in several domains. Such domains include, for example, climate mitigation, integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage in buildings, grid connections, accommodation of distributed energy generation and storage at district level, permitting, data privacy and security and the application of new technologies such as artificial intelligence. Presently, these constraints, which inhibit the demonstration of complete and qualified PEDs, require the cooperation of key professionals from the public and private sector, such as municipal and regional authorities and those from the energy and construction sectors, in complex implementation processes.\nProposals are expected to address all of the following:\nDemonstrate innovative approaches and solutions for overcoming constraints which prevent the successful implementation of PEDs;\nDevelop supportive local planning frameworks for the design and realisation of PEDs;\nDemonstrate the proposed approaches, solutions, and supportive local planning frameworks in at least three districts in diverse geographical areas that implement energy efficiency measures alongside renewable energy installations, storage solutions, digital and smart technologies, and local energy communities;\nDevelop and/or update existing guidelines, tools, and training materials for key professionals that will enable other cities to successfully replicate these innovative approaches, solutions and supportive local planning frameworks in their district/cities;\nEnsure the active involvement of all relevant public and private stakeholders, including citizens, through co-creation processes and community engagement activities.\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise (including social innovation), in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nImproved observability, monitoring and control of the electricity distribution grids;\nOptimised management (including maintenance) of the grids by system operators and improved system resilience (including withstanding natural hazards and cybersecurity incidents);\nGrid operators integrate in their practices real-time decision-making. These could be assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, if applicable;\nA 'smart substation ecosystem’ is created that includes distribution system operators, technology/solution providers, integrators, application developers etc. This should cover both high-to-medium and medium-to-low voltage levels.\nScope:\nProjects are expected to:\nDemonstrate the integration of power electronics, intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), and software solutions in the distribution substations or in their proximity;\nDemonstrate real-time monitoring and analysis of grid conditions (including power quality, voltage levels, grid component monitoring, and overall system performance) that allow operators to quickly identify and address any potential issues or disturbances, help to prevent outages and minimise the impact of service disruptions;\nConsolidate data streams from otherwise dispersed sources to create unified visualisations and consolidated analytics that offer insights into the performance of distributions substations;\nDevelop the concept of a flexible and programmable electricity distribution grid in which the substation is a centre of intelligence that facilitates optimal power routing while ensuring the resilience of the electricity grid.\nThe demonstration, test and validation of the activities should be carried out in at least two pilots in different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries.\nThe projects should propose a set of best practices and recommendations on effective overarching principles and operational measures for: (i) building smart distribution substations, and (ii) integrating them into a more resilient, intelligent, and responsive distribution grid which is able to tackle disturbances and address net congestion.\nProjects are expected to include at least five distribution system operators (DSOs) operating across different geographies and climate conditions. This total number of DSOs per project could be distributed across the different pilots of a particular project.\nAdditionally, collaboration is encouraged with the following entities:\nat least two suppliers of technologies for smart power substations;\nat least one TSO.\nThis collaboration (minimum number of entities) is sought per project in total and does not necessarily apply per each pilot in particular.\nThe selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative[1], actively participate in its activities.\n[1] https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/ [https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/](https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nBased on the results of the project, at least one industrial sector with a significant heating demand in the EU and Associated Countries develops pathways and business models to improve its energy efficiency, and to significantly reduce its consumption of fossil fuel and its emissions of GHG and other pollutants (including air pollutants), while preserving / enhancing its global competitiveness;\nWith the goal of completely phasing out the use of fossil fuels in an industrial plant with a significant heating demand, the process(es) is(are) tightly integrated to minimise energy losses and its (their) energy supply relies on the local integration of a combination of renewable energy sources, including, where appropriate, process flexibility and storage to minimise its demand on the electricity grid.\nScope:\nProposals are expected to demonstrate an innovative solution for the efficient, long lasting and cost-effective local integration of one or a combination of renewable thermal, electrical, bioenergy and other renewable energy sources in industrial processes, for heating, cooling and power generation, while optimising process efficiency and reuse, possibly upgrade of excess heat, with the aim of avoiding or drastically reducing fossil fuel use.\nProcess flexibility and energy storage can also be integrated, to match the energy demand of the industrial process with the variable renewable energy supply profile, and to minimise electricity demand from the power grid. Where possible, the integration with neighbouring industries and/or communities should be considered for the benefit of energy and resources sharing and efficiency.\nThe solution should be designed to ensure that the industrial process avoids or has very low GHG and other pollutant emissions, ensures high reliability and safety, and high physical and cyber security. It should be physically demonstrated in an industrial environment and be applicable to a significant share of the total energy demand of the industrial plant. The project should demonstrate through numerical simulations that the physically demonstrated solution can be scaled up to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels.\nThe project should facilitate the future deployment of the solution in the EU and Associated Countries’ plants in the same industrial sector(s). Already before starting the design phase, the needs of most EU and Associated Countries’ factories in the same industrial sector(s) should be surveyed and analysed in order to design a solution that can be adapted to meet most of them, to identify common components to be optimised/standardised and to issue/disseminate technical and economic guidelines.\nProposals are expected to present a strong business model and sound exploitation strategy for the proposed solution, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nAvailability of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for electricity system operators, energy service providers, and households and energy communities to enhance digital and green transformation in energy, mobility, and buildings;\nImplementation of decentralised IT solutions based on generative AI to support local grid optimisation, thereby increasing the uptake of renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and electrification of household and industrial demand at the distribution level;\nIncreased reliability, resilience, security, and energy efficiency of the energy system through advanced AI and digital tools;\nEnhanced knowledge for modernising and operating energy networks, integrating digital services, renewables, and electrification through the use of cutting-edge AI technologies;\nDevelopment of smarter demand-side tools for industries and consumers, leveraging AI to optimise energy production and consumption.\nScope:\nTo achieve the Green Deal objectives for 2030 and 2050, substantial investments are required in a smart and digitally enabled energy system capable of integrating higher shares of renewable energy and electrification of demand and electricity storage. This encompasses various sectors such as transport (notably electric vehicles), industry (heating and hydrogen production) and residential heating.\nEffective smart planning, operation and control of the electricity grid and numerous distributed devices – including smart electricity meters, smart bi-directional charging networks for electric vehicles, and smart building platforms – are essential. These efforts must be underpinned by markets for flexibility and demand response, along with seamless data exchange between actors and devices.\nOn-going innovation in the energy data space, smart Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, and digital twins for energy systems, coupled with energy price and market considerations, provide the foundation for advanced energy system intelligence. This intelligence will be further enhanced by leveraging generative artificial intelligence and the emerging AI Factories[1].\nThe scope is to develop and pilot prototypes of a generative AI-powered digital spine[2] that enhances the digitalisation and decarbonisation of the EU energy system.\nThe overall scope is the development of a prototype of an automated, AI-powered, software-defined smart energy system leveraging and further developing existing (open-source) digital solutions of lower TRLs developed in EU and national research, innovation- and deployment-programmes, as well as AI algorithms and tools provided by the AI Factories, namely to:\nDevelop and test the potential for generative AI to develop apps/programmes for local system optimisation and for system planning and operation;\nDevelop and test generative AI that can identify sources of flexibility and provide solutions for interoperability and data exchange to enable decentralised optimisation of distributed assets. This includes the integration with various data sources and sectors, such as mobility, to promote decentralisation, energy-efficiency, and cost-efficiency and to enable interoperability across different parts of the energy system;\nExplore the potential of generative AI for system optimisation through scenario generation, simulation, and time series forecasting, while also developing optimisation tools for both supply-side and demand-side management using forecasts and data for renewable energy, transmission assets, storage, and energy-saving applications for consumers;\nPropose tools and control systems to apply generative AI solutions developed in a high-risk use-case (as defined in the AI act).\nThe developed solutions should be dynamic, flexible, offering reconfigurable automated management, control and data exchange to ensure seamless operations across decentralised a setting.\nProjects are expected to:\nDemonstrate AI-powered energy services, tools for power system planning and operation, and smart grid functionalities, such as flexibility, and electric vehicle (EV) charging as well as possibly transmission system operation across at least three EU member states and/or associated countries to enhance demand flexibility and drive innovative capabilities for decarbonisation and energy efficiency;\nIndicate which generative AI basic tools, including available tools from the AI Factories, will be used and demonstrate how energy sector users will be involved in the development and the testing (and possible uptake) of the generative AI tools by the project;\nIndicate what types of assets and what data sources will be used and involved in the project;\nInvolve both traditional energy stakeholders and new entrants, such as energy service companies, aggregators, digital infrastructure providers, system integrators, energy asset manufacturers, energy communities, and active consumers;\nLeverage relevant European and international standards and technical specifications, and actively engage with standards development organisations;\nContribute to the BRIDGE initiative[3], actively participate in its activities;\nMake use of the AI Factories and solutions, open-source where relevant, building on developments in previous Horizon Europe projects, particularly those related to flexibility markets and data exchange, Internet of Things and edge-cloud computing, adhering to relevant standards and engaging with standards development organisations to further develop these standards;\nDemonstrate how the new solutions can be integrated into and/or replace (parts of) existing legacy systems, including (for projects that focus on DSOs) demonstrate how the new solutions can integrate core functions of grid operations including SCADA systems functionality;\nJointly provide a diverse set of applications of generative AI.\n[1] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories\n[2] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/accelerating-green-transition-role-digital-infrastructures-decarbonising-energy-and-mobility\n[3] https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/ [https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories) [https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/accelerating-green-transition-role-digital-infrastructures-decarbonising-energy-and-mobility](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/accelerating-green-transition-role-digital-infrastructures-decarbonising-energy-and-mobility) [https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/](https://bridge-smart-grid-storage-systems-digital-projects.ec.europa.eu/) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nMeasurable reduction in whole life carbon emissions[1] and uptake of carbon removals in buildings;\nIncreased integration of circular approaches for building construction and renovation works, with the aim of minimising lifecycle impacts;\nAvailability of more accurate benchmarks and calculations of typical buildings’ whole life carbon emissions and carbon removals, based on Level(s) and consistent with the life-cycle global warming potential provisions under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.\nScope:\nBuildings result in greenhouse gas emissions over their whole life cycle (operational and embodied emissions). Buildings can also contribute to long-term carbon removals by storing carbon in construction products. Construction and renovation works must also meet a variety of inter-related requirements such as structural and fire safety, acoustics, and a healthy and comfortable indoor environment. Although much research has focused on developing materials and products with reduced whole life carbon emissions, the life cycle impacts of buildings depend on a complex interaction between individual products, components and technical building systems, spatial distribution, usage during their lifetime, and other design choices. There is therefore a need to deliver buildings and renovation works with minimal life cycle impacts, in particular global warming potential, based on circularity principles, also accommodating future building use-change through design for flexibility, and using innovative combinations of products and systems that result in optimal building-level performance.\nProposals are expected to address all the following:\nDevelop solutions that facilitate optimal combinations of construction products and systems with minimal life cycle environmental impacts at the level of the building. The optimal combinations of products and systems must also account for relevant aspects of performance such as structural integrity, thermal, acoustic and hygrometric, durability, potential for deconstruction and preparation for reuse at end of life, and potential for automated or industrialised installation. The solutions should cover, among others, the design and construction phases of work;\nDevelop decision-related processes and strategies for adaptive reuse of existing structures, such as repurposing buildings as opposed to demolish and rebuild, considering the whole life carbon emissions;\nValidate the solutions, processes and strategies in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics;\nResearch the whole life carbon emissions of the developed solutions on typical building typologies in the chosen countries and contribute to whole life carbon benchmarking efforts;\nConsider the cost effectiveness of the developed solutions including relevant business models taking into consideration end-user needs;\nContribute to the development of European standards[2], where relevant;\nContribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and to the Built4People network of innovation clusters[3].\nSelected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on circular design and building solutions that reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and enable carbon removals, as well as performing experimental research for validating those solutions on full-scale prototype buildings.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\n[1] “Supporting the development of a roadmap for the reduction of whole life carbon of buildings”, European Union, 2023’. This publication commissioned by the European Commission includes the following definition: “Whole life carbon encompasses all greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the materials, construction and the use of a building over its entire life, including its demolition and disposal. It is thus the total amount of embodied and operational emissions.”\n[2] ‘harmonised standard’ means a standard adopted by one of the European standardisation bodies listed in Annex I to Directive 98/34/EC, on the basis of a request issued by the Commission, in accordance with Article 6 of that Directive\n[3] https://built4people.eu/nebula_project/ [Supporting the development of a roadmap for the reduction of whole life carbon of buildings](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/923706b7-8f41-11ee-8aa6-01aa75ed71a1/language-en) [https://built4people.eu/nebula_project/](https://built4people.eu/nebula_project/) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nEnergy producers and consumers benefit from improved efficiency and flexibility, reduced cost, improved reliability, robustness and security compared to existing wave energy technologies;\nWave energy technology providers profit from accelerated technology development, successful demonstrations and de-risking of wave energy technologies with a view to their commercial exploitation;\nWave energy technology providers have improved access to financing through better understanding of technological solutions and their bankability, leading to effective market uptake, business models, and commercialisation avenues;\nResearchers, industry, public authorities, and citizens have access to increased knowledge, monitoring and assessment methods and tools on the environmental, biodiversity, and socio-economic (both positive and negative) impacts of the wave energy technologies along their lifecycle and value chains;\nWave energy technology providers have detailed analysis of current costs and potential future energy cost reduction pathways and the creation of a detailed business plan for full scale commercialisation resulting in a clear path for commercial roll-out of the successful wave energy design(s) beyond the lifetime of the project;\nFunding authorities pool resources at national and EU levels dedicated to Research and Development and provide effectively a significant developmental boost of wave energy technology.\nScope:\nThe challenge is the development and demonstration of cost-effective wave energy converters that can survive in a harsh and unpredictable ocean or sea environment through demand-driven pre-commercial procurement (PCP). The challenge is open to proposals seeking to steer wave energy development in an effective way at a European level and to bring these technologies to the market.\nThe operation of wave energy prototypes in real sea conditions is a critical step to establish confidence in the devices and to facilitate the large-scale roll-out of this renewable technology. Pre-commercial procurement has been shown to be an effective tool to de-risk such activities.\nThe EuropeWave PCP action has introduced the ocean energy stage-gate process on a European-level procedure following the evaluation framework provided by Task 12 of the IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform. It supported the development of several wave energy devices in a stage-gate process to Stage 3 (approximately TRL 6). The scope of this action is to bring wave energy technologies at Stage 4 approximately TRL7/8). Designs must achieve completion of Stage 4 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas by the end of the action, including technical, socio-economic, and sustainability aspects.\nProposals have to describe their jointly identified challenge, indicating how it fits into their mid-to-long term innovation plans, and specify why solutions currently available on the market or under development are not meeting their needs.\nActivities have to include: (1) networking related to preparation, management and coordination and (2) joint research activities related to the validation of PCP strategy. The consortium should include at least three legal entities established in different member states or Horizon Europe associated countries, as well as a minimum of two 'public procurers'. Other entities with a clear added value in the preparation and/or execution of the PCP or in coordination and networking activities might be considered.\nThe proposed action is to be structured as following:\nPreparation phase:\nParticipating users/buyers of R&D services (with either a pan-European, national, or regional focus) should agree on a common set of performance levels and associated specifications for wave energy systems. The funding from the participating users/buyers and the European Union will be used to bring forward wave energy technologies and complete Stage 4 (reach TRL7/8).\nThe procurement is open to any entities established in the EU or countries associated to Horizon Europe, and the proposed wave energy technology must be able to evidence the satisfactory completion of stage 3 activities as a minimum prior-development requirement (with or without the support of EuropeWave). A phased approach can be considered to allow developers to qualify for selection for the Stage 4 demonstration. Demonstrators don’t have to be necessarily tested at the same site.\nAt the end of the preparation phase, the following results are expected: i) completed tender documents, ii) signed joint procurement agreement confirming the collaboration modus operandi including the financial commitment of the buyers’ group and iii) final confirmation of the lead procurer.\nExecution phase:\nThis phase will take care of implementing the PCP and its contracts.\nThe procurement will be executed as a single joint procedure in which different lots can be considered. The research and specification works are expected to lead to at least two commercial scale demonstrators tested for at least 12 months in a commercially representative site during the action duration following the IEA-OES[1] stage-gate metrics.\nResults will be shared with the European industry to accelerate the technology development and the establishment of guidelines and standards to facilitate the transferability of knowledge creation. At the end of the action, at least one of the demonstrators is expected to be ready for testing in an operational environment at commercial scale.\nAt the end of the action, designs are expected to be ready to proceed to Stage 5 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas (Commercial-scale array demonstration).\n[1] IEA-OES: International Energy Agency – Ocean Energy Systems Show less"

Before this go/no-go milestone, the project must deliver the detailed engineering plans, a techno-economic assessment, and all needed permits for the demonstrator. The project proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway and timeline to obtaining the permits.\nThe project has to assess the sustainability of the proposed solutions in environmental and socio-economic terms. Furthermore, the Commission initiative for Safe and Sustainable by Design[2] (SSbD) sets a framework for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials which should be considered as a reference for project proposals.\nPlans for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic are expected to include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).\n[1] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/3acfa717-b321-4f7d-b8c3-765f507d7de2_en?filename=ec_rtd_swd-2024-160-f1.pdf\n[2] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/chemicals-and-advanced-materials_en [https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/3acfa717-b321-4f7d-b8c3-765f507d7de2_en?filename=ec_rtd_swd-2024-160-f1.pdf](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/3acfa717-b321-4f7d-b8c3-765f507d7de2_en?filename=ec_rtd_swd-2024-160-f1.pdf) [https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/chemicals-and-advanced-materials_en](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/chemicals-and-advanced-materials_en) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nLimit the risks related to wind energy systems (e.g., operational, financial, climate) and thus reduce the wind energy projects’ uncertainties;\nThe European wind energy supply chain strengthens its strategic autonomy, technology leadership, competitiveness, and technology export potential.\nScope:\nProposals are expected to address at least four of the following aspects:\nDevelop and validate solutions to increase the reliability of wind energy systems and their components, thus ensuring security of supply and further reducing the environmental impacts;\nDevelop new methods, computational techniques and tools to analyse and predict the reliability of wind energy systems, considering the analysis of the failure modes of existing systems and including a focus on new analytical approaches, technologies and materials;\nDevelop new methods and tools for condition and health monitoring of wind energy systems and their components;\nDevelop and validate solutions to optimise the operation and maintenance of wind energy systems and their components, for example through improved scheduling and predictive maintenance, autonomous tools, robots and vehicles, semi-automated inspection methods or advanced repair methods;\nDevelop and validate new components to be incorporated in structures’ designs to improve the safety and efficiency on-site during maintenance activities in wind farms;\nDevelop and validate innovative digital tools to facilitate wind farm operation and maintenance, for instance through improved interoperability, decision-making support tools, condition and health monitoring techniques and innovative sensors, while ensuring increased cybersecurity and data sharing.\nThe solutions proposed have to provide solid evidence to support the choice of the sub-systems and components in focus. They have to be critical for the overall reliability of the wind energy systems. For instance, in the case of floating offshore wind, these could be dynamic cables, moorings and connection systems (electrical and mechanical) and their interaction with complex ocean flows.\nParticular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).\nDigitalisation plays a prominent role under various perspectives, for instance in terms of improved predictive maintenance activities and advanced sensors technologies for diagnostics, condition and health monitoring of the power electronics, and structural health assessment and monitoring.\nProjects should aim at reducing downtime and operational costs, enhancing safety protocols for maintenance crews, and increasing the overall lifespan and efficiency of wind energy assets.\nThese solutions should be easily standardised and/or should take into account current standardisation efforts, notwithstanding the TRL level envisaged for the projects developed under this topic.

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results under this topic are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:\nEuropean battery cell manufacturers are supported in their transition from incumbent (Gen.3) liquid electrolyte lithium-ion battery to high performance (solid-state) lithium-ion batteries;\nIncreased diversity of chemistries, cell design (application-oriented) of the existing production lines and enabling European Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to stay competitive;\nScaled production for premium products is targeted in the medium-term (for specific applications such as aviation), and large-scale production is targeted in the longer term.\nScope:\nThe scope covers quasi-solid and all-solid-state lithium-ion battery technologies (up to 5% liquid electrolyte weight percentage) which encompasses Si-C composite anodes or lithium metal anodes.\nProcess-Specific Machinery and Technological Upgrades\nProjects are expected to identify and target at least one key manufacturing process for enhancement, and to focus on optimising and testing the specific critical process(es) within existing production lines rather than overhauling the entire production system. These processes must be critical to the transition from liquid electrolyte to solid-state batteries and have the potential for high-impact improvements in terms of production yield, quality, cost, and sustainability including energy consumption.\nProjects are expected to cover all of the following tasks:\nProvide detailed plans on how existing machinery and systems can be adapted to optimise the chosen process, ensuring that these enhancements are both impactful and economically viable;\nModify existing machinery to better support the specialised requirements of the targeted process. This includes enhancing capabilities to handle new materials and designs efficiently;\nDevelop and implement technological innovations that specifically enhance the chosen process, such as precision manufacturing tools and additive manufacturing.\nFeasibility and Impact Validation\nProjects are expected to conduct pilot testing to validate the feasibility and benefits of the enhancements on the chosen process. Proposals are expected to include clear metrics for evaluating improvements, such as reductions in energy consumption, increases in production yield, and enhancements in product consistency.\nProjects are encouraged to evaluate the impact of the new or improved process on other steps in the manufacturing line, including any necessary modifications to adjacent processes, or across other parts of the production line and in different manufacturing environments.\nAdvanced Materials and Cell Design Integration\nProjects are expected to tailor the design of the produced cell to maximise the benefits of the improved process. This can be done through the development of new advanced materials or through the integration of existing materials to improve the targeted manufacturing process.\nDigitalisation, Data Integration and Analytics and Process Control\nProjects are expected to cover at least one of the following tasks:\nImplement advanced control systems and digital technologies that are specifically designed to optimise the chosen process, improving efficiency, and reducing waste;\nDevelop new process simulation methods, process models and materials chemistry models allowing to virtually assess novel cell designs’ flexible manufacturability at scale for adapted existing plants.\nIn addition, projects are encouraged to leverage data analytics and data-driven approaches (artificial intelligence) to enhance decision-making and process optimisation, focusing on the specific needs and challenges of the targeted process.\nWhenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan).\nProposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)[1] whose contribution could consist of performing experimental research on battery performance and/or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu).\nJRC shall assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic-specific FAQs under the Funding and Tenders Portal).\nProjects are expected to collaborate and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action defined under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-D2-02-06.\nTo strengthen the European battery ecosystem, projects are expected to use materials, products and equipment produced in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe, unless it is demonstrated that no valid option exists. The procurement strategies should be described in the proposal, especially and to the furthest extent possible the place of production of the elements.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\n[1] https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/laboratories-z/battery-energy-storage-testing_en Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nThe security of Europe`s clean energy system will, in the long-run, benefit from research and innovation addressing energy-security relevant criticalities of the underlying clean energy technology value chains.\nProject results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes, from which all actors of European clean energy value chains can benefit:\nStrengthened European knowledge base, skills, research and industrial leadership on solutions for energy-security related aspects of renewable energy value chains;\nTechnical and value chain solutions are developed addressing key aspects improving the energy security of renewable energy technologies;\nStrengthened availability of skilled labour (crafts, science and business) in order to increase the intra-European share of entire value chains;\nImproved competitiveness, sustainability including social awareness, and resilience of European renewable energy value chains.\nScope:\nProposals are expected to provide in-depth assessments that will lead to novel solutions improving critical aspects of specific renewable energy technologies and their respective value chains impacting EU’s energy security.\nProposals are expected to focus on the development of solutions for these critical aspects, which could highly improve the overall capacity of the specific value chain in contributing to an improved energy security for Europe in the long run. The projects must address precisely only one of the following areas:\nArea 1- Sustainability and social awareness of specific renewable energy value chains as a limiting factor for their roll-out and performance over time (this is expected to be addressed either for hydropower or bioenergy);\nArea 2- Skills for renewable energy value chains as a limiting factor for innovation and deployment of relevant clean energy technologies;\nArea 3- Complexity for specific renewable energy value chains (this is expected to be addressed either for grid based RFNBOs and/or direct solar fuels and can for example include issues such as necessary market interactions for substrates, or interfaces between different reactions).\nApplicants must explicitly indicate to which of these three areas they apply.\nProposals are expected to build on the results of the Study on clean energy R&I opportunities to ensure European energy security by targeting challenges of distinct energy value chains for 2030 and beyond[1].\n[1] European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Schleker, T., Hicks, M., Cressida Howard, I. et al., Study on clean energy R&I opportunities to ensure European energy security by targeting challenges of distinct energy value chains for 2030 and beyond final report, Schleker, T.(editor), Publications Office of the European Union, 2024, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/906828 [https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/906828](https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/906828) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nIntegration of home and building assets in an efficient way based on common Internet of Things (IoT) communication standards for smart homes and using SGAM architecture and data models (e.g., IEC CIM) for load, generation and storage devices;\nFacilitate local energy trading and distributed grid-oriented services using micro market and transactions (e.g., peer-to-peer) and improve the market participation for citizens;\nEnhance the integration of energy communities in European energy grids and increase the renewable energy share and use of flexibility by providing transparent and efficient market-based cost sharing mechanisms;\nIncrease the security of data exchange, for prosumer and customer resources, and independent (commercial) asset operators;\nIncrease synergies using a cross-sectoral approach (e.g., electricity, gas, mobility, heating/cooling) at the level of citizens and/or energy communities;\nEmpower local governments and intermediaries, strengthen overall community energy policies in EU Member States and enhance tool accessibility and user capacity at local level to promote a decentralised and co-owned energy transition.\nScope:\nThe project should:\nDevelop innovative and open-source tools for managing shared energy community assets (e.g., energy storage facilities) and optimising energy community management (e.g., selection and switching of aggregators, preparation and trading of smart contracts, peer-to-peer and energy sharing, self-consumption);\nDevelop open-source tools for forecasting, prediction and advanced data analysis using AI tools and in-depth data analysis for customers and prosumers for autonomous optimisation of consumption, production, storage, smart devices (appliances), and electric vehicle (EV) both at household and energy community levels;\nExtend DSO SCADA and substation systems for autonomous control of grid assets and seamlessly integrate these systems with home and building energy management systems for direct and fast control and data acquisition to implement local (distribution) grid services (constrain alleviation, grid reconfiguration, restoration of supply, maintenance, and enhancement of energy quality), real-time assessment and monetisation of the use of grid resources;\nIntegrate the three elements above as a basis to establish a platform for cooperation between individual customers or prosumers, entire energy communities, wide area aggregators, and DSOs to provide, acquire, and settle energy system-oriented services (system-wide balancing, support of frequency regulation). The cooperation platform should be based on a plug-and-play integration of the energy community eco-system components (hardware and software), using and extending relevant communication standards and data models. The integration mechanism should be embedded within the core systems used by customers/prosumers, DSO (and TSO), aggregators and market operators, fully aligned with SGAM;\nDevelop tailored security solutions for private and public communication networks used by IoT apps and devices (smart appliances) across energy carriers;\nEnsure the follow-up and implementation of EU policy measures, including by conducting quality assessments and introducing national community energy targets;\nFoster institutional allies at local and regional levels;\nProvide access to and capacities for using digital planning tools;\nIdentify the barriers for network operators (e.g. legal, economic, regulatory etc.) who want to introduce smart consumption options for their customers.\nPreferably semantically interoperable interactions, as enabled by the ETSI SAREF ontologies, are used. Furthermore, the project should follow the IEC TR 63097 Smart Grid Roadmap, and where relevant, the developed solutions should be open for off-shelf integration using common communication and data standards.\nThe project should benefit from the direct participation of energy communities, smart appliances manufacturers, home energy devices manufacturers, home and building energy management system developers, Distribution System Operators (DSOs), and aggregators.\nHowever, in order to comply with Article 33, 36 and 54 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, TSOs or DSOs participating in this project should not own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities or recharging points for electric vehicles. Moreover, the role of the distribution system operator in facilitating peer to peer trading should be without prejudice to the rules in Article 35 Directive (EU) 2019/944.\nThe developed solutions have to be tested within, at least, three energy communities from different European countries, preferably in regions with different socio-economic development contexts and different resource availabilities. Technical and social characteristics should be used in the project to validate the developed solutions' credibility. The demonstration sites should cover complex and technologically advanced energy communities, each located within the range of neighbouring secondary substations supplying a variety of customers/prosumers with close-to-autarky local energy generation, a range of energy vectors, a significant share of storage facilities, and flexible topology already available or to be achieved as an integral part of the project. The secondary substation should be already equipped with advanced monitoring and control systems.\nIn order to increase the replication potential of the deployed solutions the three energy communities are invited to closely collaborate with similar energy communities.\nThe selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative and actively participate in its activities. Additional contributions to the ‘Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation’ (AIOTI) and other relevant activities (e.g., clusters of digital projects and coordinating actions) might be considered when relevant.\nIn particular, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nAdvanced European innovative knowledge basis and increased technology competitiveness in the area thermal storage;\nImproved security of the future European renewable-based energy system;\nContribution to the decarbonisation of cities and densely populated urban areas with high safety solutions;\nSignificant reduction of LCOHS (Levelised Cost of Heat Storage);\nLocal communities are engaged and their expectations are responded to.\nTechnology developers practice inclusive societal engagement which is early, continuous, and sensitive to the technical specificities (e.g. local resource, subsurface uncertainties) and social challenges (e.g. low public awareness) of underground thermal energy storage technologies in the context of densely populated urban areas.\nScope:\nIn scope are novel technologies, interfaces, design methods and organisational concepts that result in the most effective and sustainable use of subsurface space in dense urban areas by Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) systems such as ATES, CTES and BTES.\nProposals should consider the integration in the existing energy grids and interaction with other urban uses of the subsurface (e.g., subways, underground utilities, buildings), including energy geostructures of buildings, tunnels, slabs, energy sheet pile walls, etc., with potential geothermal heating, cooling, and sinks or storage opportunities.\nProposals should address the uncertainties in the seasonal energy demand to increase the predictability of the required subsurface space, the interactions among systems for the sake of optimal use of subsurface and thermal efficiency.\nProjects are expected to deploy one or more demonstrators and can address, for example, one or more of the following exemplary areas:\nOptimal utilisation of geothermal resources and thermal energy storage in urban settings, addressing high (above 70 degrees Celsius), medium (30-70 degrees Celsius) and/or low temperatures (10-30 degrees Celsius) and possible requirements for retrofitting of the building stock;\nSubsurface models for a sustainable underground thermal storage and geothermal use in cities;\nThe integration of heat pumps, advanced thermal storage, and interface with district heating infrastructures to contribute to the thermal and power grid flexibility;\nStudying the impact of subsurface urban heat islands (SUHI) on the potential of shallow geothermal energy use in cities, using, for instance, long-term subsurface monitoring networks, satellite monitoring and models;\nBest practices strategies for subsurface land-use plans in European cities; well/borehole placement strategies;\nMutual interaction of existing and future neighbouring UTES systems from geotechnical, energy, and regulatory point of view;\nManagement of energy grids on an urban scale and system optimisation thorough digital twins predicting operational, environmental and economic response, as well as the interaction between the storage system and the local grids, under different scenarios;\nCreation of large (time and scale-wise) open multisensory datasets to foster heat energy storage at the European scale which should adhere to the FAIR data principles, adopt data quality standards, data integration operating procedures and GDPR-compliant data sharing/access good practices developed by the European research infrastructures, where relevant.\nUse of advanced monitoring systems such as fibre optic sensors, satellite imagery, etc. for monitoring and early detection of adverse impact of UTES at a district scale level and providing measures to mitigate such effects.\nConsideration should be given to de-risking solutions, and dedicated support schemes that guide innovative energy storage technologies through to the commercialisation stage. The consortium should assess the current regulatory context and provide recommendations linked to the proposed solutions for shaping future needs (e.g., regulatory, standardisation, permitting). In addition, appropriate local community engagement initiatives as well as expectations and experiences of underground thermal storage infrastructures (and to what extent it varies in dense urban areas) should be explored.\nThis topic requires citizens engagement and dialogue and the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities and ensure the translation of innovation into real-life outputs.

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nMeasurable reduction in buildings’ energy demand together with a reduced gap between their as-designed and as-built energy performance;\nMeasurable increase in the number of building typologies with smart grid connected renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage together with increased flexibility in grid/network management and operations;\nMeasurable enhancement of the smart readiness of buildings as rated by the Smart Readiness Indicator and/or other relevant building rating systems;\nImproved responsiveness by the relevant stakeholders to the needs and concerns of users from a diversity of social groups, including vulnerable and disadvantaged ones, involved in or potentially affected by the smart buildings, thereby increasing the potential for beneficial societal uptake and building trust in outcomes.\nScope:\nThe construction sector and the building subsector remain among the least digitised. Smart buildings can contribute to reducing energy demand, curbing operational CO2 emissions, integrating RES and enhancing grid flexibility through optimised energy usage. At the same time, it is essential that smart buildings are flexible and adaptive to changing needs and usage patterns and are user-friendly to encourage widespread adoption of these technologies by grid operators, construction professionals, building facility managers and users. Furthermore, to ensure the societal benefits of the smart building technologies there is a need for increased user knowledge, acceptance and satisfaction.\nProposals are expected to address all of the following:\nDevelop solutions that enhance the smartness of buildings by using and facilitating the upgrade of existing Building (Energy) Management Systems (BMS/BEMS) and/or other technical equipment;\nEnsure that the proposed solutions are user-friendly and provide the expected indoor environmental quality, as well as user satisfaction and occupant comfort;\nDemonstrate the proposed solutions in at least three pilots. These pilots should collectively cover at least three different climatic zones, three different building types (residential, tertiary etc.), and three different technical building systems;\nDevelop a methodology to measure the achieved energy demand reduction, increased flexibility in the grid, and enhanced interoperability, compared to current best practices;\nInvestigate the cost-effectiveness and replicability of the proposed solutions.\nThis topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot:\nProposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal readiness pilot, as described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to deepening consideration and responsiveness of research and innovation activities to societal needs and concerns.\nThis topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio-technological interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related activities. Show less"

Proposals shall address capture of CO2 either from one of the following areas (and explicitly identify which is being covered):\nPoint sources, or\nDirectly from air (direct air capture, DAC).\nDepending on the capture routes chosen (e.g., solvents, sorbents, membranes, cryogenic, solid looping), examples of important issues to address include enhanced absorption/adsorption, improved kinetics and reduced energy use for CO2 capture and desorption, new materials with high selectivity for CO2 capture, flexibility of operation, modularisation and scale-up, space occupation, degradation and life span of capture materials, ability for retrofit, potential for heat integration, and solvent-induced corrosion.\nIn particular for DAC, examples of important issues to address are novel sorbent or solvent materials that have higher CO2 capture capacities and longer-term stability in the presence of heat and air. For all proposals, minimisation of health and environmental impact must be addressed in the project also in view of future scaling up. The developed technologies should aim at delivering CO2 at the specifications required for transport and storage, with very low levels of impurities.\nFor point-source capture, the technologies should address the performance profile and characteristic when operating under variable operating conditions such as load changes to maintain and as high as possible capture rate across the entire operating profile. Results from point-source capture should provide good matches between specific industrial application and capture technology while guaranteeing the quality and continuity of the industrial process.\nThe use of the European Research Infrastructure for CO2 Capture, Utilisation, Transport and Storage ECCSEL is encouraged but not mandatory.\nIn particular for DAC, international cooperation with participating countries of the Mission Innovation Carbon Dioxide Removal Mission[1] is encouraged.\n[1] Carbon Dioxide Removal – Mission Innovation (mission-innovation.net) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:\nShortened development time of battery cells and battery systems by minimising the experimental testing effort, thus reducing the overall costs and the time to market;\nIncreased battery reliability and safety through better understanding of ageing, and safety-relevant (deactivation, degradation, failure) mechanisms;\nAcceleration of a more reliable verification and validation of new solutions contributing to increased user acceptability (safety, performance & costs) and competitiveness of the European battery value chain;\nStandardised battery system testing & validation approaches focussing on the combination of physical and virtual test methodologies.\nScope:\nThis topic aims to reduce development costs and time to market of new battery systems by accelerated multi-physical and virtual testing. Current test strategies are still very time consuming and costly due to the need to understand the impact of multi-physical operational loads (electric, thermal, mechanical, etc.), potential failure modes, ageing and misuse on the safety and reliability of battery cells and modules.\nTo overcome these barriers, new multi-physical test strategies supplemented by virtual testing are required taking into account the most impactful parameters on ageing, reliability and safety and their dependencies.\nProposals are expected to address Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries and are encouraged to develop techniques and methodologies which are applicable to other forms of electro-mobility as well as stationary applications (including second life).\nProposals are expected to address and demonstrate all the following activities:\nUnderstand and describe the impact of multi-physical operational loads, failure modes, ageing and misuse on battery reliability and safety highlighting the dependencies between them in order to design the most adequate testing methods and parameters;\nDerive advanced operating profiles for testing and development of novel X-in-the-Loop (XiL) test environments for multi-physical and accelerated testing addressing electrical, thermal and mechanical loads at the same time;\nCombine physics-based with data-driven test strategies enabling reliable virtual and physical battery testing considering specific applications;\nDevelop simplified test strategies reducing the number of tests and their complexity while improving battery safety and reliability. Synergies between different battery chemistries, including next generation battery designs and sizes must be exploited where possible, allowing to re-use or scale test results from cell to system level;\nResearch activities are also expected to lead to advanced response strategies for damaged and aged batteries. Furthermore, a contribution to the European safety classification system is expected by developing standards for this safety classification. To this end, proposals are expected to establish contact and exploit complementarities with selected proposals under topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-03 “Safe post-crash management of road Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (2ZERO Partnership)” with regards to monitoring techniques for safety risks, algorithms for defining state of health and remaining useful life.\nActivities covering the following aspects are encouraged:\nDevelopment of virtual methods for full system validation using physical sub-system results;\nDevelopment, exploitation, and harmonisation of advanced battery cell or pack measurement and diagnostic methods for enhancing the data depth and breadth over what is currently available. Definition of performance indicators relating to battery degradation and safety, and development of methods for the validation of digital models.\nApplication of AI and generative AI for the definition of the design of experimental and testing strategies to increase the outcome of experimental testing campaigns, in order to accelerate achievement of significant conclusions, and to thus reduce testing time and effort.\nWhenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).\nProposals are expected to also establish cooperation and complementarity with the selected proposal under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-02-03: “Creating a digital passport to track battery materials, optimise battery performance and life, validate recycling, and promote a new business model based on data sharing (Batt4EU Partnership)” with regards to safety and ageing information as part of the battery passport.\nProposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)[1] whose contribution could consist of performing experimental or desk-top research on battery performance and/or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the JRC’s website (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal, or request specific information from the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu)\nJRC shall assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic-specific FAQs under the Funding and Tenders Portal).\nProjects are expected to collaborate and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action defined under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-D2-02-06.\nTo strengthen the European battery ecosystem, projects are expected to use materials, products and equipment produced in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe, unless it is demonstrated that no valid option exists. The procurement strategies should be described in the proposal, especially and to the furthest extent possible the place of production of the elements.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\n[1] https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/laboratories-z/battery-energy-storage-testing_en Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nThe EU’s Offshore Strategy[1] underlines that the deployment of offshore wind should be based on maritime spatial planning, assessing the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the installations in a life-cycle perspective, while ensuring co-existence with other activities such as commercial and recreational uses of the sea and fishing. At the same time, it calls for research on the cumulative impacts of offshore energy generation on the environment, which was also underlined in the Communication on Delivering on the EU offshore renewable energy ambitions (2023)[2].\nOur knowledge on such impacts, positive and negative, is more advanced now than when the Offshore Strategy was adopted[3]. However, there are still significant data and knowledge gaps. Most fieldwork studies have been carried out at very localised sites and often focused on specific species. These ad-hoc studies lead to conclusions that can hardly be generalised. A sound monitoring, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on ecosystems and their services, at wider scale and in interaction with other sea activities, is still largely missing. There is also a need to further develop models and other instruments for environmental risk assessment, identification of mitigation measures and recommendations for restoration measures, considering impacts during construction, operation and maintenance, repowering and decommissioning.\nImproving instruments, data, and knowledge on the cumulative environmental impacts of offshore energy, as well as a sound monitoring, is key to ensure that its expected fast and large-scale deployment will be sustainable. It will also better equip the EU to contribute to mitigate such impacts and promote sustainable deployment of offshore wind at regional (e.g., through OSPAR[4] in the Northeast Atlantic) or subregional (e.g., through the Greater North Sea basin Initiative) level.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nThe scientific community, public authorities, project designers, permitting authorities, civil society organisations and citizens have better tools (including Maritime Spatial Planning tools), reliable data and knowledge to monitor, assess and minimise the cumulative environmental, including on biodiversity, and socio-ecological impacts of large-scale bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy generation, including at sea-basin level and when combined with other planned or existing human activities;\nThe monitoring of cumulative environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, of offshore wind installations is improved, with better tools and open data, in a coherent scheme with pre-existing monitoring programs of the marine environment at large scale;\nAmbitious national and regional offshore wind deployment targets are achieved with positive or minimum negative impacts on the marine and coastal environment;\nDeploy offshore wind energy with minimal impact on marine and coastal ecosystems, and, if possible, with net-positive ones.\nScope:\nProposals are expected to address at least five of the following aspects:\nProvide better knowledge and understanding of the cumulative environmental impacts of the offshore wind energy deployment according to the EU targets, when added to the current and planned human activities carried out in the same areas;\nExpand existing studies, field monitoring, and analysis from local to larger areas, and from site- or species-specific impacts to more general ones. Further develop and deploy field monitoring activities, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems and their services, as well as pollution, from installation to decommissioning and possible repowering, including operational phase and maintenance activities;\nTest and demonstrate field monitoring and modelling technologies that allow to go beyond state-of-knowledge, regarding life-cycle environmental impacts of offshore wind energy deployments;\nImprove instruments and models for Maritime Spatial Planning, and environmental assessments at plan and project level that are in alignment with public authorities’ needs;\nImprove modelling capacity and environmental impact assessments of future offshore wind deployment;\nSupport the identification of areas where wind energy deployment is particularly suitable without significant environmental impact and areas where on the contrary, it should be avoided;\nIdentify strategies, test, and demonstrate technologies that avoid, minimise, mitigate and compensate the environmental impact of bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy systems, propose mitigation and restoration measures and if feasible, provide net-positive environmental impacts. The activities carried out under this point are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project.\nParticular attention must be dedicated to ensuring that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) and to leveraging existing community practices for data sharing especially those in the relevant European common data spaces and in the European Research infrastructures.\nComplementarities with other ongoing and upcoming Horizon Europe projects are expected to be ensured as well as with the European Digital Twin of Ocean (European DTO) and its core infrastructure, for instance the projects funded under topics:\nHORIZON-CL6-2025-02-CLIMATE-02: The ocean-climate-biodiversity-people nexus: uncovering safe operating space for safeguarding the integrity and health of the global ocean;\nHORIZON-MISS-2025-03-OCEAN-08: EU Digital Twin Ocean: Contribution to the EU DTO core infrastructure through applications for sustainable ocean management;\nHORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-06: Innovative nature-inclusive concepts to reconcile offshore renewables with ocean protection;\nHORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-08: Integration of socio-ecological models into the Digital Twin Ocean;\nHORIZON-CL5-2024-D3-02-08 Minimisation of environmental, and optimisation of socio-economic impacts in the deployment, operation and decommissioning of offshore wind farms.\nIn addition to considering the most evident environmental impacts of offshore wind energy systems (displacement, collision risk, exposure to aerial and underwater noise, habitat loss and degradation, pollution, etc.), funded projects must include an analysis of possible new impacts, that may become particularly relevant when a high number of wind energy systems is deployed, for instance in relation to the decommissioning and removal of end-of-life offshore wind energy systems, the presence of dynamic cables suspended in the water column, the impact of submarine geohazards on the dynamic cables or the production of microplastics.\nEnvironmental monitoring data must be open source and be shared with the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the International Energy Agency Wind Energy Systems Technology Collaboration Programme’s (IEA Wind TCP) Task on the environmental effects of wind energy.\n[1] COM(2020) 741 final\n[2] COM (2023) 668 final - EUR-Lex - 52023DC0668 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)\n[3] See for instance the ETC/ICM Report 2/2022: Mapping potential environmental impacts of offshore renewable energy, at: https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-icm/products/etc-icm-reports/etc-icm-report-2-2022-mapping-potential-environmental-impacts-of-offshore-renewable-energy\n[4] https://www.ospar.org/ [European Digital Twin of Ocean (European DTO)](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/restore-our-ocean-and-waters/european-digital-twin-ocean-european-dto_en) [core infrastructure](https://edito-infra.eu/) [COM (2023) 668 final - EUR-Lex - 52023DC0668 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52023DC0668) [https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-icm/products/etc-icm-reports/etc-icm-report-2-2022-mapping-potential-environmental-impacts-of-offshore-renewable-energy](https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-icm/products/etc-icm-reports/etc-icm-report-2-2022-mapping-potential-environmental-impacts-of-offshore-renewable-energy) [https://www.ospar.org/](https://www.ospar.org/) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:\nDemonstration of combined solutions for infrastructure construction that achieve the following targets:\nAt least 50% of the construction materials used are recycled or sourced from recycled materials;\nReduced pollutant emissions by at least 30% considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure;\nReduced degradation of ecosystems and fragmentation of habitats during construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of transport infrastructure (thereby contributing to maintaining biodiversity);\nIncreased climate resilience of infrastructure to extreme weather and human caused events, assuring at least 80% capacity at network level during the disruptions;\nStructured analysis and recommendations on the need for EU standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure;\nGuiding document on the necessary adaptations to public procurement rules that contribute to including clear sustainability and resilience award criteria.\nScope:\nThe overarching policy background is the European Grean Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In the transport area, this translates into a 90% reduction of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050[1]. To deliver the European Green Deal, there is a need to revise and upgrade numerous policies, including those for transport and large-scale infrastructures.\nThe EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[2] (SSMS), which translates this overall transport target into actions, states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that such infrastructure should rely on clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, as well as on a modernised grid.\nResearch in this topic should provide knowledge and technical solutions to a triple challenge: (1) limiting emissions of transport infrastructures; (2) making them more resilient to climate change; and (3) addressing environmental and biodiversity aspects. Projects should cover the entire life cycle of transport infrastructures, covering overall emissions from sourcing of materials, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure.\nProposals should address all of the following aspects:\nDevelopment of new methods and techniques to construct, manage, maintain and repair (including self-repair) transport infrastructures, in order to increase climate resilience and lower emissions;\nAssessment of solutions considering the principles of circularity and taking into account the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) approach;\nCost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the solutions considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure and accompanying business plans for their implementation;\nApplication of innovative materials (e.g. green asphalt, green cement, carbon sinks) that enable transport infrastructures to become more resilient, more sustainable and emit less pollutants;\nValidation of all the proposed solutions and proofs of concepts is to be carried out in at least two large-scale demonstrations. The demonstrations should cover at least two different transport infrastructure types (e.g., road, rail, waterborne, airport) which are located on at least two different Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors. The demonstrations should also cover different environments and phases of the infrastructure life cycle (e.g. design, construction, maintenance, decommissioning);\nAnalysis of EU national and international standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure;\nDesign of green, sustainable and innovative public procurement methods, contributing to lowering the environmental footprint, resources, and material consumption;\nDemonstration of sustainable and climate resilient infrastructure with nature-based solutions (NBS[3]), minimising the negative effects on the environment, including the degradation of ecosystems, the fragmentation of habitats and the loss of biodiversity.\nThe projects should develop clear indicators with baselines and quantified targets in support of the expected outcomes that are monitored for each demonstration site. With regards to the expected outcomes, projects should take into account expected technological developments and policy implementation (e.g. revised TEN-T regulation), multi-disciplinary adaptive capacity in line with the European Climate Risk Assessment[4] (EUCRA) and the Commission Communication on Managing Climate Risks[5], in particular cascading impacts across sectors.\nProposals should consider and build on results from previous calls on resilient and sustainable infrastructure and standards,[6] and should incorporate relevant EU guidance on the development and management of European transport infrastructures. Proposals should also build on previous results from projects on advanced materials, sensor technology, digitalisation, asset management, decision support and automation in the construction and maintenance of infrastructures. If the proposed activities and solutions involve the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and/or techniques, the proposal is expected to demonstrate that robustness of the solution.\n[1] Transport and the Green Deal - European Commission (europa.eu)\n[2] https://transport.ec.europa.eu/document/download/be22d311-4a07-4c29-8b72-d6d255846069_en?filename=2021-mobility-strategy-and-action-plan.pdf\n[3] https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/environment/nature-based-solutions_en\n[4] European Climate Risk Assessment — European Environment Agency (europa.eu)\n[5] EUR-Lex - 52024DC0091 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)\n[6] https://im-safe-project.eu/ [Transport and the Green Deal - European Commission (europa.eu)](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/transport-and-green-deal_en) [European Climate Risk Assessment — European Environment Agency (europa.eu)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment) [EUR-Lex - 52024DC0091 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52024DC0091) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nThe proposals are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:\nExtended functionalities of electronic Freight Transport Information (eFTI) platforms beyond the required actions forming part of the implementation of Regulation 2020/1056[1] for:\nnew use cases, solutions and applications, enabling harmonised electronic business-to-business (B2B) information sharing and exchange in multimodal logistics chains and hubs such as those related to greenhouse gases (GHG) reporting, sustainability claims and other actions leveraging efficient and green freight operations in the supply chain;\ncomplementary applications and services for electronic business-to-authority (B2A) information sharing aimed to support the implementation by businesses of relevant Union regulatory frameworks in transport or in other relevant policy fields, such as in the context of smart enforcement, statistics, customs, e-invoicing, sustainability reporting, data spaces, GHG and external costs calculators;\nBest practices to boost and accelerate the adoption of eFTI framework and data sharing innovations by companies and in particular by SMEs are established;\nImproved efficiency in operations and freight transport, through the provision of advanced digital connectivity and interoperability of the information shared electronically between actors in both B2B and B2A perspectives, compared to the baseline defined in the start of the project, is demonstrated and quantified;\nReduced administrative burden and costs associated with B2B data sharing and B2A regulatory and non-regulatory reporting are demonstrated and quantified.\nScope:\nElectronic Freight Transport Information (eFTI) platforms established in line with Regulation 2020/1056 will play a central role in facilitating the implementation of business-to-authority (B2A) information exchange processes related to multimodal transport of goods. In line with the Regulation’s requirements, common specifications for a single comprehensive data set and harmonised protocols for data sharing will ensure interoperability of the information shared electronically between actors, and the requirements for rights-based access-control system will establish safeguards for cybersecurity and trust. The use of electronic means to exchange regulatory information is also expected to reduce administrative costs for economic operators, to enhance the efficiency of freight transport services and to facilitate green transformation of the logistics sector.\nTherefore, given their potential, apart from specific B2A functionalities, eFTI platforms could also serve as an enabler for other universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to achieve digital interconnectivity of logistics systems and platforms including in a business-to-business (B2B) perspective.\nThe proposals should unlock the potential of eFTI platforms for further functionalities, beyond the scope of Regulation 2020/1056, to new B2B services and applications as well as other B2A uses.\nProposals should refer, as a core principle, to the legislative framework and specific technological solutions provided through Regulation 2020/1056, while duly reflecting the latest technological state of the art for electronic information exchange. Where relevant, and especially in B2B perspective, they should apply and build upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing and exchange in transport, the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF) and the European mobility data space (EMDS).\nOutside the scope of this topic is any type of architecture, federation of platforms or similar, as these are already delivered by eFTI and DTLF. Proposals also should not develop functionalities already required in the current scope of the eFTI Regulation. Instead, they are expected to leverage and/or extend functionalities of eFTI platforms that are in operation at the time of the implementation of the project, to ensure the effective implementation of new use cases.\nBuilding on the functionalities, requirements and implementation specifications for eFTI platforms provided for in the eFTI Regulation and its implementing and delegated acts, the proposals should address all of the following aspects:\nDevelop technical solutions and tools, at least at the level of operational prototype demonstration (TRL7), for complementary applications and services for electronic B2A information sharing;\nDevelop universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to enable electronic B2B information sharing in collaborative logistics processes. The proposed solutions should be implemented with minimal integration effort for industrial stakeholders, for instance through the usage of Artificial Intelligence to facilitate data and information interoperability.\nDevelop solutions and tools to facilitate SMEs engagement in the digital freight transport and logistics ecosystem and the adoption of solutions by SMEs.\nDefine multiple use cases, services and application of eFTI platforms for B2B and B2A processes duly accounting of relevant existing solutions and projects and identifying specific barriers to interoperability and universal adoption.\nIdentify and define relevant data to be added to the existing eFTI common dataset to support the new use cases, services and functionalities; while addressing aspects of data sovereignty, data privacy and cybersecurity, pursuant to the relevant Union legislation;\nAssess and provide recommendations for B2B framework arrangements, including standard data exchange contracts, identification/authentication and authorisation to ensure trusted operations in data sharing and exchange in freight transport and logistics;\nDefine and seek synergies with relevant EU frameworks and policies related to the exchange of transport emissions data (such as new Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on CountEmissions EU[2], the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive[3], and other relevant Union acts) to facilitate their effective and harmonised implementation, including through the establishment of an open source emissions calculators, as well as the exploitation of data sharing frameworks for carbon reporting between operators in the same supply chain;\nAssess the interdependencies and needs with horizontal Union strategies and legislation such as GDPR[4], digital identities[5], data spaces[6], AI act[7], Data Governance Act[8], Cybersecurity Act[9]; identify best practices and provide recommendations for compliance.\nDefine and test B2A and B2B solutions and use cases in at least 2 demonstration environments/ecosystems involving platforms and users. B2B use cases should be led by industry stakeholders, in particular shippers and logistics service providers (e.g. freight forwarders, transportation companies). B2A use cases should be developed in cooperation with industry stakeholders, researchers and public administrations, including statistical offices.\nIdentify and develop best practices, map solutions and value streams. Provide recommendations on incentives, capability building, training and technology adoption support schemes as well as trust building mechanisms – to facilitate, encourage and accelerate the adoption of eFTI platforms and data sharing and exchange innovations by companies and in particular by SMEs.\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2020 on electronic freight transport information; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/1056/oj.\n[2] Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52023PC0441\n[3] Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32022L2464\n[4] Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\n[5] Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024 amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing the European Digital Identity Framework; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj\n[6] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-spaces\n[7] Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence and amending Regulations (EC) No 300/2008, (EU) No 167/2013, (EU) No 168/2013, (EU) 2018/858, (EU) 2018/1139 and (EU) 2019/2144 and Directives 2014/90/EU, (EU) 2016/797 and (EU) 2020/1828 (Artificial Intelligence Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\n[8] Regulation (EU) 2022/868 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022 on European data governance and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 (Data Governance Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32022R0868\n[9] Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (Text with EEA relevance); https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32019R0881 [Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF)](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/digital-transport-and-logistics-forum-dtlf_en) [European mobility data space (EMDS)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13566-Transport-data-creating-a-common-European-mobility-data-space-communication-_en) [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/1056/oj](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/1056/oj) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:\nKnowledge of high-risk locations along the road network becoming available, before crashes actually occur, enabling road authorities to deploy appropriate countermeasures proactively;\nPredictive identification of safety-critical situations based on data from multiple sources and enabling real-time interventions to avoid crashes;\nDetermination of the optimal sample size to allow for reliable real-time crash occurrence prediction;\nEnhanced monitoring of traffic flows and incorporation of traffic flow variations and patterns in real-time crash prediction, which will also lead to more effective traffic management by foreseeing unexpected or disruptive events.\nScope:\nOne of the principles of the Safe System Approach is to turn from mainly re-active to pro-active management of road safety, i.e. not to derive needs for intervention primarily from crash investigations, but to intervene before serious crashes happen. The ubiquitous gathering of ever-growing amounts of data and their processing in the digital transport system support this idea providing valuable information on traffic situations and events. Potential data sources include amongst others: smart phones, wearables, connected vehicles, drones, road-side sensors (e.g. camera, radar), etc. Progress in computing power, in the accuracy of location services and in video analytics are further enablers in the processing and analysis of such data in order to identify safety-critical situations or conflicts based on surrogate safety metrics.\nIn terms of crash prediction modelling artificial intelligence has the potential to identify the underlying risk and the complex relationships between large and diverse datasets which in turn could lead to the identification of crash contributing factors and their interrelations. The identification of these risk factors may then allow predicting safety-critical situations at quantifiable risk levels and guide the proactive implementation of crash avoidance measures, as proposed amongst others by the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ideally, interventions would be feasible in real-time and increase the safety of all road users.\nProposals should address all the following aspects:\nDevelopment of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin of traffic and infrastructure. This would integrate historical, current, and forecast data, including crowdsourcing and infrastructure sensors, infrastructure topology and condition, along with environmental (e.g. local weather and visibility) and road and traffic conditions. Such a digital twin can allow monitoring and preventively optimising both safety and traffic flow, equally addressing congestion and resilience issues. Results from existing projects like OMICRON[1] could be considered. The proposals should also explore the possibility and usefulness of other type of data such as sociodemographic and economic data, behavioural driving data, data from security cameras, among others that could be provided by third parties (tourism, planned events, demand, etc.);\nAnalyse in detail the technical challenges associated with the acquisition and use of adequate and reliable big data from multiple sensors in the road transport system, as well as the process of combining these datasets in ways that are meaningful for proactive road safety analysis;\nDevelop methods and tools to predict safety-critical traffic situations at quantifiable risk levels based on real-time and historical data;\nAccount for biases in the datasets and ensure that the developed AI-based models or algorithms are bias-free, so that the safety of all road users will be improved effectively in a fair, non-discriminatory way;\nAnalyse in detail also the non-technical challenges associated with this approach and the inherent need to collect and share large amounts of data that can be used to identify and quantify road safety-related risk factors. Ethical, legal and economic issues should be considered and concepts be developed to overcome these challenges in terms of privacy concerns, questions of data ownership, organisational barriers etc;\nAnalyse what real-time countermeasures can be taken to reduce instantaneous risk levels for all road users complementary to existing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) services;\nDemonstrate the feasibility of such risk predictions and targeted interventions;\nBuild consensus among relevant stakeholders on possible routes for deployment in coordination with other ITS services.\nParticular attention should be dedicated on establishing interoperability standards for data sharing, through the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles and leveraging on already adopted practices especially those in the relevant Common European data spaces.\nWays to leverage valuable complementary data, e.g. metadata from crash databases, should also be explored, as well as links to initiatives for European data spaces.\nResearch is expected to develop recommendations for updates to relevant standards and legal frameworks. International cooperation is advised, in particular with projects or partners from the US, Japan, Singapore and Australia. Knowledge and experience from other modes where similar approaches are followed in much more controlled environments should be leveraged.\n[1] https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/955269 Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:\nInput is provided for the implementation of the existing and forthcoming Union’s regulatory initiatives related to measurement, calculation and reporting of emissions in transport, such as Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime)[1], Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation)[2], and the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU)[3];\nMethodological components are developed and proposed to complement the methodology for accounting emissions provided under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU.\nScope:\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport represent around 25% of total man-made GHG emissions and continue to grow. The negative impact of these is further strengthened by the existence of other external costs of transport, including air pollution, noise, congestion and accidents. The EU, Member States and industry have made considerable efforts to reduce transport-related GHG emissions and associated external costs.\nAccurate and reliable information on emissions is an important tool to increase effectiveness of specific emission reduction measures undertaken by public authorities and businesses. Over the past 15 years, a lot of progress has been made at EU level and globally through new regulatory actions and continuing collaboration between actors to improve the transparency of transport GHG emissions and external costs monitoring. This is manifested through:\nRegulatory initiatives including Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime)[1], Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation)[2], Regulation (EU) 2015/757 (EU MRV)[6] and especially, the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU)[3], and Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive);\nRelevant EU research projects, including “Carbon Footprint of Freight Transport” (COFRET), “Logistics Emissions Accounting & Reduction Network” (LEARN) and the on-going “Creating Legitimate Emission Factors for Verified GHG Emission Reductions in Transport” (CLEVER)[8];\nStandardisation work, including ISO 14083, the official international standard developed between November 2019 and October 2022 and published in March 2023 as part of the 14000 family of ISO GHG-related standards[9];\nRegular updates of the Handbook on the External Costs of Transport[10];\nIndustry initiatives, such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, the industry-led guideline for GHG calculation and reporting in the global logistics sector.\nBuilding on the initiatives listed above, proposals should undertake further work to ensure that:\nThe full climate impact of transport operations is covered in a comprehensive and consistent way;\nRelevant open items identified in the emissions accounting reference methodology set out under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU can be scientifically clarified and closed;\nAny detailed tweaks to the methodology that have come to light through application can be developed and tested in view of the implementation of the CountEmissions EU framework;\nNew technologies, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, are considered in developing datasets and methodologies;\nRelevant data is available for the proper implementation and seamless integration of requirements set in other EU climate related legislation in transport, including Regulations on Fuel EU Maritime, ReFuelEU Aviation, EU MRV, and Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 on electronic freight transport information[11].\nThe Action will play a central role in contributing to the establishment of an unambiguous scientific framework aimed to tackle emissions in transport. However, the Action should also facilitate alignment between EU policy development and market implementation, especially towards enabling market-based accounting approaches that would support proactive investment in low emission fuels and associated transport services.\nThe proposals should address all of the following aspects:\nExplore, assess and establish the state of the art regarding issues of measuring and calculating specific types of transport-related emissions for which there is no clear consensus on the market, in particular:\nblack carbon emissions, which primarily result from the combustion of fossil fuels in compression ignition engines;\nradiative forcing, which has been suggested as having a strong supplementary climate impact at high altitude and is already included in an inconsistent manner across some, but not all, transport GHG reporting programs;\nGHG emissions from vehicle manufacturing and scrappage, which, although not directly linked to transport operations, do contribute to overall life cycle transport emissions;\nGHG emissions that result from the installation of transport infrastructure, which would need to include the definition of rules for the combination of operational and life cycle emission calculations into a meaningful and consistent presentation format;\nGHG emissions related to the maintenance operations associated with transport operations that are currently excluded;\nGHG emissions from information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and data servers that support the delivery of transport operations.\nClarify specific methodological issues for enabling more accurate quantification of emissions and setting proper incentives towards efficient and sustainable transport options, addressing in particular:\na detailed methodology for GHG emissions stemming from temperature-controlled transport and cool chain operations;\nallocation of GHG air transport emissions across passengers and freight transported on the same aircraft.\nBased on relevant European/national/sectorial repositories, explore, assess and contribute to an EU core dataset of default values for GHG emissions intensity of transport services, including for supporting relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as CountEmissions EU);\nBuilding on the results of the CLEVER project, where relevant, update the list of applicable GHG emission factors for emissions stemming from energy production, distribution and use, in particular in the context of relevant EU regulatory initiatives (such as CountEmissions EU). Consistency with data and methodologies in current energy legislation such as Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive)[12] must be ensured;\nDefine R&I gaps on emissions accounting of transport and provide scientifically sound recommendations to address those gaps to improve the existing GHG emissions measuring framework.\nThe project’s main governance (e.g. Steering Group, Advisory Board) is expected to provide for direct involvement of all relevant stakeholders.\nMechanisms to ensure coordination between other ongoing or selected projects (e.g. CLEVER) during their implementation should be put in place where applicable.\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC\n[2] Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport\n[3] COM(2023) 441 final\n[4] Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC\n[5] Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport\n[6] Regulation (EU) 2015/757 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 on the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC\n[7] COM(2023) 441 final\n[8] https://emissionfactors.eu/\n[9] This standard has also been formally adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) under the reference CEN ISO 14083\n[10] https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/9781f65f-8448-11ea-bf12-01aa75ed71a1\n[11] Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2020 on electronic freight transport information\n[12] Directive (EU) 2023/2413 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 amending Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and Directive 98/70/EC as regards the promotion of energy from renewable sources, and repealing Council Directive (EU) 2015/652 Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nPhotovoltaic (PV) energy systems are one of the cheapest and fastest growing sources of electricity generation, largely thanks to an important decrease in the cost of solar modules in the last 10-15 years, and to their simple installation. The PV market is changing fast, recently transitioning to high-efficiency crystalline silicon cell concepts (e.g., Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon), Heterojunction (HJT), Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC), tandem, etc.), larger modules or novel designs (e.g., bifacial), use of new materials (e.g., anti-reflection and anti-soiling coatings, thinner glass, new encapsulants and backsheets), or increased number and topology of busbars or wires. There is no PV lifetime definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected degradation rate of 0.8% per year. However, abnormal degradation rates are still reported for cell and module technologies due to a variety of failures which reduce reliability and increase the cost of PV systems operation.\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nReduced degradation to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes;\nIncreased module durability and reliability;\nResource efficiency and lifelong energy yield improvement of PV systems;\nDecreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE);\nExecution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda[1].\nScope:\nThe degradation rate might vary depending on many factors such as material properties, environmental stress (solar irradiance, humidity, temperature, wind speed, dust, etc.), installation, design and type of components and connections, with some components deteriorating on their own and others impacting additional PV components, leading to more severe failures. To tackle these issues and extend the lifetime of PV modules (and systems) proposals are expected to:\nIdentify defects and failure modes encountered in recently developed high-efficiency or novel design c-silicon modules themselves and their components, exploring their mechanisms and root causes, reviewing each component’s susceptibility to defects and failures and impacting additional PV components;\nDevelop, where necessary, simple, cost-effective and accurate module defect detection techniques (including through Artificial Intelligence (AI)), applicable to most PV modules and systems;\nPropose mitigation approaches at module and system level and validate approaches through modelling and/or AI modelling and lab testing;\nPerform outdoor field experiments and testing to determine degradation rates and/or to identify defects and failure modes and estimate service lifetime.\nDifferent locations representing the European range of climates are to be considered for field experiments.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\n[1] Commission Staff Working Document \"Solar energy joint research and innovation agenda with Member States in the context of the European Research Area (ERA)\" [Commission Staff Working Document \"Solar energy joint research and innovation agenda with Member States in the context of the European Research Area (ERA)\"](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/3acfa717-b321-4f7d-b8c3-765f507d7de2_en?filename=ec_rtd_swd-2024-160-f1.pdf) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nMeasurable reduction in overall time spent on site for renovation and construction, compared to current best practices;\nMeasurable increase in resource efficiency, as well as improved accuracy (designed vs. as-built), of on-site renovation and construction works, compared to current best practices;\nMeasurable reduction in noise pollution, air pollution (e.g., particulate matter) and other pollution caused by on-site renovation and construction works, compared to current best practices.\nScope:\nBuildings need to be sustainable and resource efficient, and the rate of deep renovation needs to be increased. This can be accelerated by modernising the construction sector and embracing the latest developments in robotics and automated systems. There is need for further research on innovative on-site robotic and other automated solutions and techniques that make renovation and construction works more sustainable, less disruptive, faster, as well as more accurate, cost effective and resource efficient.\nProposals are expected to address all of the following:\nTest and validate the use of innovative on-site robotic and automated solutions and techniques both for construction of buildings and for renovation of which at least one must investigate 3D printing;\nApply a research methodology which allows for a robust comparison of at least the three expected outcomes of the proposed innovative solutions and techniques with current best practices;\nInvestigate aspects of on-site workers’ safety and human-robot collaboration related to the future application of the proposed solutions and techniques;\nTest and validate at least three prototype solutions and techniques to investigate their applicability for a variety of building typologies, duly justified to represent a relevant part of the European building stock. The prototypes should be validated in a lab or another relevant environment. Testing and validation must address solutions for both renovation and construction. The prototypes should be applicable either to renovation, or to construction, or to both, but both renovation and construction need to be addressed in a proposal.\nSelected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value regarding various aspects of on-site robotics for construction and renovation, as well as performing experimental research for validating full-scale prototype buildings renovated and/or constructed with robotic solutions.

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nEnhanced solutions and tools to better integrate inland waterway transport (IWT) into the overall logistic chains and increase the modal share of inland waterway transport, are developed and demonstrated in use cases in line with the objectives set up in NAIADES III[1];\nGains (compared to the baseline defined in the beginning of the project) in terms of operational efficiency, as well as environmental and social impact from the integration of IWT in multimodal logistics chains, are clearly identified, demonstrated and measured;\nRecommendations for an EU regulatory framework on harmonised smart shipping at EU level, as well as input for related standardisation, harmonisation and amendments to Inland Water Transport Digitalisation Vision[2] to reflect findings from the project;\nStakeholder engagement and communication campaigns and events to increase visibility and use of IWT are organised.\nScope:\nWhile the increased use of sustainable transport modes and multimodal solutions are critical levers for transport, logistics and supply chain decarbonisation, and despite obvious environmental advantages, the modal share of the EU IWT sector has remained below expectations over the last decades. The seamless integration of inland waterway transport in multimodal supply chains requires the physical and digital connection to other land transport modes and maritime transport. Digitalisation is not a goal in itself but an important supporting development required to remain competitive and to improve the connectivity to ports, other transport modes and the clients (e.g. to keep the direct costs low and to allow synchromodal solutions). Digital interconnectivity (with logistics systems and other digital platforms for transport) is crucial to increase the modal share of IWT in multimodal logistics chains and to be able to significantly contribute to the modal shift goals as presented in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[3].\nProposals are expected to focus on the integration of smart vessels, smart infrastructure, smart data and smart governance in multimodal logistics chains. The proposals should address all of the following aspects:\nBuilding on the results of previous and on-going Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funded projects, identify, develop and test robust technical and operational solutions and tools (also exploring innovative technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence) to connect physically and digitally IWT to existing land and waterborne multimodal logistics chains for a sustainable, efficient, safe, resilient, automated IWT with a view to synchromodal transport;\nDefine and develop key parts of the IWT-related aspects of a common framework for multi-modal data sharing, while enabling compatibility with legacy systems; building upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing in transport, such as the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), the European mobility data space (EMDS), the electronic Freight Transport Information regulation; and considering high value datasets, the revised Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Directive[4] and River Information Services (RIS) Directive. Outside of the scope are any type of new platforms or similar; rather, proposals are expected to leverage existing frameworks or platforms to ensure effective use case implementation (e.g. proposed solutions could interface with and be integrated in existing platforms used by shippers, carriers and freight forwarders to connect with multimodal information). Proposals could also identify datasets already available or that could be developed in order to enhance the integration of IWT in multimodal supply chains;\nDefine and test applications and use cases, building on the proposed solutions for advanced cooperative Smart Shipping and Smart Logistics, including integration with the physical infrastructure, in at least four demonstration pilots in actual operational environments (minimum at TRL 7). The pilots should focus on better integrating inland waterway transport in the multimodal supply chains, with a focus on cross border applications, on the accessibility and usability of node services in an automated/digital manner, and on efficient and green operations. The pilots should cover different types of goods, different routes and IWT basins (to have better EU geographical coverage), possibly along the Trans-European Transport Network corridors. To ensure a user and governance perspective approach, the pilot cases should be led by industry stakeholders (e.g. freight forwarders, intermodal operators), in cooperation with shippers and public administrations (involvement of public administrations is considered a priority). The impact of increased automation and digitalisation on all stakeholders should be considered as part of the requirements definition and throughout the design life cycle;\nThrough the pilots and the application of the proposed solutions, analyse the existing relevant regional/national regulations, identify gaps and legal barriers, and propose recommendations for an EU regulatory framework on harmonised smart shipping at EU level, as well as input for the standardisation and harmonisation of the smart shipping components to the relevant standardisation bodies (e.g. CESNI, CEN, CENELEC);\nBased on the pilots’ results, assess and quantify, in a comprehensive, structured and substantiated analysis, the environmental, economic and social benefits of smart shipping (including automated vessels and the link to the physical infrastructure), and the effects of increasing the use of IWT in multimodal logistics chains. Develop and propose new business models to incentivise the use of IWT;\nFoster collaboration among key stakeholders, including transport operators, logistics providers, shippers, policymakers, and technology developers, also by implementing communication activities and organising an outreach event displaying the pilots’ results and the demonstrated advantages of integrating IWT in multimodal logistic chains.\n[1] COM(2021) 324 final eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0324\n[2] https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/core/api/front/document/98613/download\n[3] Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy – putting European transport on track for the future, COM/2020/789 final\n[4] Directive (EU) 2023/2661 [eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0324](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0324) [https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/core/api/front/document/98613/download](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/core/api/front/document/98613/download) [Directive (EU) 2023/2661](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=CELEX:32023L2661) Show less"

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nCCAM solutions - in hardware and software - with reduced power consumption, latency, and improved speed and accuracy, as domain specific adaptions of sector agnostic advancements in e.g. AI and/or cloud-edge-IoT technologies;\nEnhanced levels of safety, (cyber) security, privacy and ethical standards of data-driven CCAM functionalities by using e.g. edge-AI applications for CCAM;\nApproaches for well-balanced distributions of AI calculations for expanding use cases (e.g. collective perception, decision making and actuation) for connected, cooperative and automated driving applications (using a balanced mix of edge-based solutions, cloud-enabled solutions and vehicle-central solutions), balancing speed and latency, energy use, costs, data sharing and storage needs and availability;\nValidated approaches incorporating edge-AI solutions into the action chain from perception and decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM functionalities - both on-board and on the infrastructure side - for systemic applications such as traffic management and remote control, as well as tools and approaches for training of such functionalities, which require optimised and verified edge-AI models.\nScope:\nCCAM-enabled vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings on road conditions, location, nearby vehicles and infrastructure. Such data is shared in real-time, while data from other sources is received. This needs powerful and optimised large data processing algorithms, which requires large amounts of computing power, data processing, real-time operation and high levels of security. However, most existing AI computing tasks for automated vehicle applications are relying on general-purpose hardware, which has limitations in terms of power consumption, speed, accuracy, scalability, memory footprint, size and cost. Hardware advancements driven by initiatives such as the Chips JU calls must be complemented by significant efforts to optimise AI algorithms for CCAM functionalities, ensuring their efficient performance on edge-specific hardware.\nTo encompass CCAM solutions in future steps towards e.g., the Software Defined Vehicle, this dual approach on AI advancements and hardware advancements is essential. Complementarities with projects funded under Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe should also be considered where appropriate, especially in translating sector-agnostic innovations to the specificities of CCAM applications. Requirements on AI algorithm optimisation, latency, on-board energy availability, solutions to gain unbiased datasets for AI training, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) capacity and on potential safety-critical scenarios should be considered to ensure the timely triggering of actions, and in a later stage, anticipatory driving. Solutions should use, as far as possible, building blocks, interfaces, and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative.\nEdge-AI involves deploying AI algorithms on edge computing devices, which are hardware systems constrained in proximity to the data source where they operate. This is done without relying on remote resources for the computational efforts. It thus facilitates real-time insights, responses and triggering of actions, with reduced costs as the processing power close to the application is used, greatly reducing networking costs. Combining AI with edge-AI can facilitate stable solutions to include the full activity chain from sensing, perception, decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM solutions, gaining speed and resilience which are essential in safety-critical situations.\nTo successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:\nFor next major advancements in AI applications in CCAM solutions, huge AI applications need to fit into limited hardware, to make it fit for purpose. Edge-AI devices often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to deploy large and complex AI models. Thus, it is essential to develop and reshape approaches and building blocks for CCAM solutions, viable to be run on edge-hardware. Use cases for the approaches and building blocks should focus on time-critical applications (such as the chain from (collective) perception, decision making and actuation of functionalities) and can be linked to the activities and results from projects AI4CCAM[1] and AIthena[2].\nDevelop optimised edge-AI algorithms and demonstrate their applicability and scalability, using real-world CCAM scenarios such as in the databases resulting from projects such as SYNERGIES[3]. The development and demonstration use case should include in-vehicle perception and understanding, such as object detection, segmentation, road surface tracking, sign and signal recognition, etc. Decision making and actuation of countermeasures is to be part of the chain of actions. The approaches for these building blocks and enabling technologies should facilitate a quick uptake in adjacent or following projects;\nOptimisation of the models for edge deployment. This involves adjusting the size and complexity of models to allow it to run on the relevant edge devices and include training and verification approaches. Techniques such as model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation can be used to reduce the size of AI models without significant loss in performance. Additionally, over-the-air (OTA) updates can be used to manage and update models across a fleet of devices efficiently;\nDevelop tools and approaches for edge-AI model monitoring, to ensure that edge-AI systems continue to operate as expected and ensure resilience to failure conditions or attacks, and monitoring model outputs to ensure they are accurate even as real-life conditions and datasets change.\nThe research will require due consideration of cyber security, connectivity and both personal and non-personal data protection rules, including compliance with the GDPR, and ensure that gender and other social categories (such as but not limited to disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnic or racial origin, sexual orientation, etc.), and their intersections are duly considered where appropriate, as well as Explainable AI to enhance trust and regulatory compliance including alignment with the AI Act.\nIn order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies in edge AI approaches for mobility and for CCAM, as well as its integration into the vehicle architecture.\nThis topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.\nProjects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM[4].\nProjects funded under this topic are encouraged to explore potential complementarities with the activities of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre’s Sustainable, Smart, and Safe Mobility Unit and, where appropriate, establish formal collaboration.\n[1] Trustworthy AI for CCAM, grant agreement ID: 101076911.\n[2] AI-based CCAM: Trustworthy, Explainable, and Accountable, grant agreement ID: 101076754.\n[3] Real and synthetic scenarios generated for the development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems, grant agreement ID: 101146542.\n[4] See the evaluation methodology here.

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nIncreased foreign[1] venture investments from funds from 'strong' or 'innovation leader' innovator regions and enabling later-stage growth for expansion to these regions of local start-ups from less connected and developed innovation ecosystems ('emerging” or 'moderate' innovator regions);\nIncreased foreign investors’ awareness and access to the flow of local deals from 'emerging' or 'moderate' innovator regions;\nImproved foreign investors’ knowledge on regulatory frameworks and networks/syndicates to support joint cross-border venture investment in the above characterised underserved markets.\nImproved start-ups’ knowledge from 'emerging' or 'moderate' innovator regions on market and regulatory frameworks and expectations from networks in foreign 'strong' or 'innovation leader' innovator region to support their expansion and access to funding in these regions;\nIncreased available and committed venture capital in less connected innovation ecosystems, enhancing their scale, diversity, breadth, openness and potential.\nScope:\nThe lack of later-stage funding and partners for expansion to foreign markets is one of the most problematic aspects of business growth particularly for the startups from less developed innovation ecosystems. In order to scale to a leading business, startups need to expand to foreign markets beyond their region. At earlier stages start-ups are typically supported by local investors and partners. However, in order to expand inside the EU they would need access to the funding from actors with presence and knowledge in these new markets. The lack of partners for expansion to foreign markets beyond their region is harmful for local start-ups’ growth and investor activity and the development of regional scale-ups, even more so for women-led companies. While the limited number of established European start-up hubs attract significant money and traction, the innovation ecosystems in other areas struggle to keep pace with fewer resources, including funds and technical expertise. In the struggle for resources, many start-ups face the choice to either forego growth and ultimately close their business or move elsewhere, while foreign investors struggle to enter new markets due to insufficient information about the market, its opportunities and regulatory frameworks.\nIf organised and structured, investments ecosystems should be able to attract foreign investors into “emerging’ and ‘moderate’ innovation ecosystems by raising awareness of local innovation ecosystems and their start-ups, as well as the potential of the whole region, to capital providers from across Europe. Foreign investors should be interested to support startups from these ecosystems to expand to other markets and increase their connectivity to relevant partners and market knowledge.\nThe action supports co-designed programmes of activities, of at least two (2) years, proposed by business acceleration service providers and/or investor networks and clubs, and/or innovation hubs[2] located in less developed innovation ecosystems (‘emerging’ and ‘moderate’) and more developed ones (‘strong innovators’ and innovation leaders’), to facilitate the entry of foreign funders from ‘strong innovators’ and innovation leaders’ regions to less developed innovation ecosystems through activities, including at least five of the examples below:\nmarket orientation/introduction programmes for foreign investors, including establishment of central points of information for foreign investors providing them with knowledge on the ecosystem's establishment conditions, incentives, tax and local legislation;\nmarket orientation/introduction programmes of developed markets for local startups and funds, including establishment of central point of information providing them with knowledge on the ecosystem's establishment conditions, incentives, tax and local legislation;\nassistance to foreign investors during the whole process of investment, from the pre-entry stage until the exit, by ensuring support in administrative, legal, linguistic and cultural issues;\nroadshow to leading innovation hubs to showcase the potential of the local ecosystem, its promising start-ups and active local investors;\norganisation of European international business forums, conferences and events to attract and connect foreign investors with local investors;\nestablishing cooperation with public and private buyers of innovative solutions and with the innovative companies they are buying from; peer-matching of investors and business angles and other networking activities to encourage joint ventures;\na repository of best practices of market entry facilitation for foreign investors;\na repository of best practices of market entry facilitation for startups from 'emerging” or 'moderate' innovator regions to markets of foreign 'strong' or 'innovation leader' innovator regions;\na list of recommendations for local authorities and European regulators to better address investors’ entry challenges and facilitate cross-border deals.\nAll of these activities should be targeted to one or several of the 5 burning challenges of the New European Innovation Agenda in order to ensure more targeted and tailored match between participants and more tailored services. The 5 burning challenges include: reducing the reliance on fossil fuels, increasing global food security, mastering the digital transformation (including cybersecurity), improving healthcare and achieving circularity.\nTo ensure that the impact of the action goes beyond consortium members and their respective countries, it is encouraged that the consortium works closely with innovation agencies and/or similar government organisations, supporting start-ups and development of innovation and entrepreneurship from their respective territories and beyond, and seeks synergies with relevant EU initiatives such as the Enterprise Europe Network, as well as with the other projects funded under this topic.\n[1] For the purposes of this topic, foreign should be understood as from a different EU Member State or Associated Country.\n[2] Innovation hubs encompass a wide range of stakeholders, including entities from both the private and public sectors, as well as incubators and accelerators.

            "CONNECT - Interconnected Innovation Ecosystems (2025) Today’s urgent challenges are inherently complex and systemic and will not be solved by individual actors or territories in isolation. Fostering enabling innovation ecosystems across the European Union (EU) requires a systemic approach that is inclusive and collaborative, involves diverse actors, institutions and territories, maximises the value of innovation to all, and ensures equitable diffusion of its benefits.\nAs highlighted in the European Commission Communication on a New European Innovation Agenda[1], by increasing the inclusion and interconnection of less represented regions and actors into a more strongly integrated European ecosystem, the EU can capitalise on the experience, needs, visions, and perceptions of an increasingly diverse range of people, companies and territories. In doing so, it can also take forward a uniquely inclusive European innovation model that is sustainable, guards against substantial labour market and wage gaps, and associated threats to territorial and social cohesion.\nMoreover, such well-connected and diverse ecosystems provide innovative companies with the necessary support and conditions to thrive, i.e. through additional capabilities, data, customers, knowledge, and talents. Network connectivity within and between innovation ecosystems greatly contributes to sustainable business growth with high societal value. Therefore, the actions of this destination aim at strengthening and expanding cooperation between innovation players to better support the next generation of innovative companies whose solutions will lead the shift towards a more competitive EU and a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient world.\nBesides stronger innovation performance, increased competitive sustainability, and more rapid transitions to a green and digital society, ecosystem integration can provide ecosystem actors and companies with access to new resources, markets, customers, and contribute to disruptive and innovative solutions. By being actively engaged in their local, regional, national, and European networks, companies can increase their overall growth potential.\nThis destination offers a holistic package of actions that:\nStrengthen innovation ecosystems across the EU through fostering more efficient, inclusive, gender diverse, and connected innovation ecosystems, by accelerating the development and deployment of innovation, including deep tech[2] innovation and encouraging co-planning, co-implementation, and co-investments around European strategic priority areas;\nEnsure the inclusion of all key innovation players from across the quadruple helix[3], and all EU territories;\nMobilise policies, funding instruments (EU, national, regional) and fostering synergies between them;\nImprove public and private buyers’ capacity to procure innovative solutions and enhance coordination on innovation procurement initiatives within Member States and Associated Countries;\nPromote interregional collaboration and investments with a view to improving territorial cohesion;\nEnsure openness and cross-fertilisation of the innovation ecosystem within and beyond the EU's borders.\nIn particular, the actions under this destination should promote the creation of links:\nEnsure inclusiveness and diversity with the involvement of varied innovation actors from the quadruple helix, for example, individual inventors, industry, startups, scaleups and SMEs investors, innovation hubs, business associations, clusters, public and private buyers of innovative solutions as well as citizens and civil society organisations.\nAmong ‘innovation leaders’ and ‘strong innovators’ with ‘moderate’ and ‘emerging innovators’[4] across the EU and Associated Countries[5] to increase innovation cohesion[6];\nWith networks such as National Contact Points, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), and European Innovation Council (EIC) communities, the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), clusters and Euroclusters, European university alliances, Missions, pan-European platforms such as Startup Europe, public and private regional or local innovation actors, in particular incubators and innovation hubs (e.g. European Research Area hubs and Digital Innovation Hubs);\nInvestEU financial instruments and advisory services bridging access to finance and de-risking projects beyond their upscaling phases, or\nany other EU programme that could interconnect innovators.\nWhere appropriate, the applicants should consider and actively seek synergies with possibilities for further funding from other relevant EU, national and/or regional innovation programmes, including Cohesion Policy funds, the Recovery and Resilience Fund, the EU's External Action instruments, the Growth plan for the Western Balkans[7], the Growth Plan for Moldova[8] and the Ukraine Plan[9], and other public and private funds or financial instruments.\nExpected impact\nProposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to strengthening robust interconnected innovation ecosystems and creating a favourable environment to promote the scalability potential of businesses, including in the deep tech sector, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:\nInterconnected, inclusive, and more efficient innovation ecosystems across the EU that draw on the existing strengths of European, national, regional, and local ecosystems and engage new, less well-represented stakeholders and less advanced innovation territories, including rural areas, to set, undertake, and achieve collective ambitions tackling challenges for the benefit of society, including green, digital, and social transitions, and advancing the European Research Area and the New European Innovation Agenda;\nEnhanced cross-border network connectivity and inter-regional collaboration for better innovation performance in the EU with reinforced connections between more and less innovative regions building on strategic areas of regional strength and specialization to create and renew European value chains in areas most relevant for the sustainable green and digital transition and the EU’s open strategic autonomy, including the five “burning challenges”[10] as defined in the New European Innovation Agenda;\nEnhanced capacity building, experience sharing and cooperation fostering wider implementation of innovation procurement, to shorten the time-to-market for innovative solutions that respond to concrete procurement needs and societal challenges.\nIncrease innovation co-investments, fostering synergies and other funding leverages;\nImproved innovation policy coordination and networking activities of the Member States and Associated Countries through the EIC Forum.\n[1] A New European Innovation Agenda, COM(2022) 332 final\n[2] Deep tech is referring to technology that is based on cutting-edge scientific advances and discoveries and is characterised by the need to stay at the technological forefront by constant interaction with new ideas and results from the lab. “Deep tech” is

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nEnhanced capacity of public procurers to carry out PCPs and PPIs;\nIncreased amount of PCPs and PPIs taking place at national level and across borders by transnational buyer groups;\nEnhanced awareness among companies, in particular startups and SMEs, of the possibilities offered by innovation procurements to grow their business, by promoting national innovation procurement business opportunities to companies across other EU Member States and Associated Countries;\nIncreased amount of EU wide published preliminary market consultations and calls for tenders for PCP and PPI procurements and active promotion of those business opportunities to innovators in EU Member States and Associated Countries;\nIncreased recognition of the strategic importance of PCP and PPI by policy makers and in national policies, contributing to increase innovation procurement uptake;\nExpansion and intensification of innovation procurement support measures implemented by innovation procurement competence centers across Europe.\nScope:\nMany public buyers around Europe still lack experience on innovation procurement and need training and guidance. To tackle this challenge, several countries around Europe have set up national competence centers that cooperate with policy makers in their country to implement capacity building measures for innovation procurement. With support of Horizon 2020 funding, in the past, five new competence centers were set up and started collaborating with five existing competence centers across borders[1].\nEurope wide benchmarking identified that there are still significant gaps in national capacity building structures for innovation procurement[2]. This action therefore aims to support setting up a European wide network of national competence centers for innovation procurement[3], inspired by the experience and activities of the previous initiative, and extend it further to additional countries and reinforce its activities.\nActivities undertaken by the network are expected to include the creation of new national competence centers for innovation procurement[4] as well as the enlargement and deepening of the scope of activities of existing competence centers. The expected minimum participation is 10 existing national competence centers for innovation procurement plus 5 public bodies that have the mandate to setup 5 new national competence centers for innovation procurement in 5 different Member States or Associated Countries, with at least 2 of the 5 new ones in ‘emerging’ or ‘moderate’ innovator countries[5]. The network will thus start with participation from at least 15 different EU Member States or Associated Countries and it is expected to aim for participation of national competence centers for innovation procurement from all Member States in the network by the end of the project.\nActivities undertaken by the network should also include experience sharing on the implementation of pre-commercial procurement (PCP) and public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI) across Europe, promoting Horizon Europe funding and synergies with ESIF funding for PCP and PPI to public procurers in cooperation with NCPs as well as supporting public procurers in launching such procurements.\nCooperation among public procurers is important because potential market size is a key decision factor for firms to participate or not in a public procurement and to help them grow their business across Europe. Scaling up the impacts of completed innovation procurements by diffusing the uptake of innovative solutions to other public buyers is also vital to mainstream innovation procurement. Activities undertaken by the network are therefore also expected to facilitate the creation of national and transnational buyer groups that ensure wider diffusion of innovations from innovation procurements as well as the creation of transnational buyer groups that start new joint innovation procurements on new topics. In this context, attention should be paid to reinforcing procurements that involve strategic technologies that are key for safeguarding Europe’s economic security. The network is also expected to promote national innovation procurement business opportunities to companies across other EU Member States and Associated Countries. It is encouraged to collaborate closely with the EIC business acceleration services and the Enterprise Europe Network to ensure a wide outreach among European startups and SMEs and raise their awareness on the business opportunities offered by innovation procurement across EU Member States and Associated Countries.\nPlanned activities are also expected to include collaboration with national policy makers that are responsible for the policies that support the uptake of innovation procurement, in particular R&I and public procurement policies. The competence centers should cooperate with such policy makers to develop and coordinate policy actions to mainstream PCP and PPI across Europe such as implementing action plans, targets, monitoring and incentive schemes that encourage public procurers to undertake more PCPs and PPIs.\nThe network is expected to maximize synergies with national and ESIF funding and focus the budget requested from Horizon Europe on activities/partners that cannot be funded from ESIF or for which national funding is not available. The network is expected also to cooperate with other Horizon Europe funded initiatives on innovation procurement to maximize impact and synergies where possible.\nThe expected duration for the action is 4 years.\n[1] The procure2innovate project funded a European network for competence centers on innovation procurement between 2017 and 2021: procure2innovate: European network of competence centres for innovation procurement | Procure2Innovate | Project | News & Multimedia | H2020 | CORDIS | European Commission\n[2] The 30 countries analysed by the benchmarking have put in place just 27% of capacity building measures to support public buyers to mainstream innovation procurement: https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/support-policy-making/shaping-eu-research-and-innovation-policy/new-european-innovation-agenda/innovation-procurement/benchmarking-innovation-procurement-investments-and-policy-frameworks-across-europe_en\n[3] A competence center on Innovation Procurement is an organization/organizational structure that has been assigned the task by the government of a Member State or Associate Country and has a mandate according to national law to encourage wider use of innovation procurement, that includes among others providing practical and/or financial assistance to public procurers in the preparation and/or implementation of PCP and PPI procurements across all sectors of public interest.\n[4] New competence centers can include both entities that want to setup a competence center that does not exist yet and still need to start up during the project their first capacity building activities as well as entities that are already providing a few ad hoc innovation procurement capacity building activities but are not yet a national competence center with a systematic and more comprehensive set of capacity building activities.\n[5] For the purposes of assessing which participant represents a ‘moderate’, ‘emerging’, ‘strong’ or ‘innovation leader’ country, the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) is the reference.

            "CONNECT - Interconnected Innovation Ecosystems (2025) Today’s urgent challenges are inherently complex and systemic and will not be solved by individual actors or territories in isolation. Fostering enabling innovation ecosystems across the European Union (EU) requires a systemic approach that is inclusive and collaborative, involves diverse actors, institutions and territories, maximises the value of innovation to all, and ensures equitable diffusion of its benefits.\nAs highlighted in the European Commission Communication on a New European Innovation Agenda[1], by increasing the inclusion and interconnection of less represented regions and actors into a more strongly integrated European ecosystem, the EU can capitalise on the experience, needs, visions, and perceptions of an increasingly diverse range of people, companies and territories. In doing so, it can also take forward a uniquely inclusive European innovation model that is sustainable, guards against substantial labour market and wage gaps, and associated threats to territorial and social cohesion.\nMoreover, such well-connected and diverse ecosystems provide innovative companies with the necessary support and conditions to thrive, i.e. through additional capabilities, data, customers, knowledge, and talents. Network connectivity within and between innovation ecosystems greatly contributes to sustainable business growth with high societal value. Therefore, the actions of this destination aim at strengthening and expanding cooperation between innovation players to better support the next generation of innovative companies whose solutions will lead the shift towards a more competitive EU and a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient world.\nBesides stronger innovation performance, increased competitive sustainability, and more rapid transitions to a green and digital society, ecosystem integration can provide ecosystem actors and companies with access to new resources, markets, customers, and contribute to disruptive and innovative solutions. By being actively engaged in their local, regional, national, and European networks, companies can increase their overall growth potential.\nThis destination offers a holistic package of actions that:\nStrengthen innovation ecosystems across the EU through fostering more efficient, inclusive, gender diverse, and connected innovation ecosystems, by accelerating the development and deployment of innovation, including deep tech[2] innovation and encouraging co-planning, co-implementation, and co-investments around European strategic priority areas;\nEnsure the inclusion of all key innovation players from across the quadruple helix[3], and all EU territories;\nMobilise policies, funding instruments (EU, national, regional) and fostering synergies between them;\nImprove public and private buyers’ capacity to procure innovative solutions and enhance coordination on innovation procurement initiatives within Member States and Associated Countries;\nPromote interregional collaboration and investments with a view to improving territorial cohesion;\nEnsure openness and cross-fertilisation of the innovation ecosystem within and beyond the EU's borders.\nIn particular, the actions under this destination should promote the creation of links:\nEnsure inclusiveness and diversity with the involvement of varied innovation actors from the quadruple helix, for example, individual inventors, industry, startups, scaleups and SMEs investors, innovation hubs, business associations, clusters, public and private buyers of innovative solutions as well as citizens and civil society organisations.\nAmong ‘innovation leaders’ and ‘strong innovators’ with ‘moderate’ and ‘emerging innovators’[4] across the EU and Associated Countries[5] to increase innovation cohesion[6];\nWith networks such as National Contact Points, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), and European Innovation Council (EIC) communities, the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), clusters and Euroclusters, European university alliances, Missions, pan-European platforms such as Startup Europe, public and private regional or local innovation actors, in particular incubators and innovation hubs (e.g. European Research Area hubs and Digital Innovation Hubs);\nInvestEU financial instruments and advisory services bridging access to finance and de-risking projects beyond their upscaling phases, or\nany other EU programme that could interconnect innovators.\nWhere appropriate, the applicants should consider and actively seek synergies with possibilities for further funding from other relevant EU, national and/or regional innovation programmes, including Cohesion Policy funds, the Recovery and Resilience Fund, the EU's External Action instruments, the Growth plan for the Western Balkans[7], the Growth Plan for Moldova[8] and the Ukraine Plan[9], and other public and private funds or financial instruments.\nExpected impact\nProposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to strengthening robust interconnected innovation ecosystems and creating a favourable environment to promote the scalability potential of businesses, including in the deep tech sector, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:\nInterconnected, inclusive, and more efficient innovation ecosystems across the EU that draw on the existing strengths of European, national, regional, and local ecosystems and engage new, less well-represented stakeholders and less advanced innovation territories, including rural areas, to set, undertake, and achieve collective ambitions tackling challenges for the benefit of society, including green, digital, and social transitions, and advancing the European Research Area and the New European Innovation Agenda;\nEnhanced cross-border network connectivity and inter-regional collaboration for better innovation performance in the EU with reinforced connections between more and less innovative regions building on strategic areas of regional strength and specialization to create and renew European value chains in areas most relevant for the sustainable green and digital transition and the EU’s open strategic autonomy, including the five “burning challenges”[10] as defined in the New European Innovation Agenda;\nEnhanced capacity building, experience sharing and cooperation fostering wider implementation of innovation procurement, to shorten the time-to-market for innovative solutions that respond to concrete procurement needs and societal challenges.\nIncrease innovation co-investments, fostering synergies and other funding leverages;\nImproved innovation policy coordination and networking activities of the Member States and Associated Countries through the EIC Forum.\n[1] A New European Innovation Agenda, COM(2022) 332 final\n[2] Deep tech is referring to technology that is based on cutting-edge scientific advances and discoveries and is characterised by the need to stay at the technological forefront by constant interaction with new ideas and results from the lab. “Deep tech” is distinct from ‘high tech’ which tends to refer only to Research & Development intensity.\n[3] A model of cooperation between industry, academia, civil society and public authorities, with a strong

            "Expected Outcome:\nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:\nEnhanced development of deep tech[1] ecosystems around pan-European research infrastructures[2] to generate, scale and deploy breakthrough technologies with market and societal value;\nIncreased involvement of industry, including SMEs, with research infrastructures to raise the technology level and competitiveness of companies and generate market opportunities, including through the generation of start-up or spin-off companies;\nImproved valorisation of the socio-economic impact of past investments in pan-European research infrastructures from the European Structural and Investment Funds;\nFoster the potential of pan-European research infrastructures for innovation training and education.\nScope:\nPan-European research infrastructures are strategic assets to boost R&I, scientific discoveries and deep-tech developments at regional, national and European levels. They have a strong role in increasing the R&I potential of academia and industry in local and regional ecosystems, thus enhancing competitiveness, innovation in strategic areas and overcoming fragmentation. The Council conclusions on strengthening the competitiveness of the EU and overcoming the fragmentation of the European Research Area[3] encouraged better use and deployment of Research Infrastructure facilities and services by academia and industry, including SMEs and start-ups across the entire EU.\nAs providers of advanced services and procurers of cutting-edge technologies, RIs have an innovation potential related to the development of components, instruments, services and knowledge that could be better exploited to push the edge of existing technologies and lead to their deployment for market-oriented or socially useful purposes.\nThe aim of the action is to respond to industry needs and to better valorise interactions that research infrastructures have with companies, facilitating deep collaboration and co-development.\nThe proposals should pilot the possibility to seed the development of innovation ecosystems around diverse technological areas related to pan-European research infrastructures by providing grants to pilot projects in three to five different technological areas.\nThe proposals should:\nidentify deep tech innovations with breakthrough potential related to pan-European research infrastructures;\nassess the feasibility and scalability of the identified innovations;\nsuggest a selection and clustering of those innovations that demonstrate sufficient maturity to provide a clear potential for industrial implementation and demonstrate the strongest market and societal value;\nrun, evaluate calls and give convincing arguments to provide grant funding to pilot projects in the identified technological areas;\nassess the outcome of the pilot grants.\n[1] C.f. deep tech definition on footnote 18.\n[2] ESFRI: www.esfri.eu\n[3] Council Conclusions on Strengthening the competitiveness of the EU, reinforcing the European Research Area and overcoming its fragmentation [www.esfri.eu](https://www.esfri.eu/) [Council Conclusions on Strengthening the competitiveness of the EU, reinforcing the European Research Area and overcoming its fragmentation](http://european-research-area.ec.europa.eu/news/council-adopted-conclusions-era-and-competitiveness#:~:text=At%20the%20Competitiveness%20Council%20%28Research%29%20on%20Friday%2C%2029,the%20European%20Research%20Area%20and%20overcoming%20its%20fragmentation%22.)

            "CONNECT - Interconnected Innovation Ecosystems (2025) Today’s urgent challenges are inherently complex and systemic and will not be solved by individual actors or territories in isolation. Fostering enabling innovation ecosystems across the European Union (EU) requires a systemic approach that is inclusive and collaborative, involves diverse actors, institutions and territories, maximises the value of innovation to all, and ensures equitable diffusion of its benefits.\nAs highlighted in the European Commission Communication on a New European Innovation Agenda[1], by increasing the inclusion and interconnection of less represented regions and actors into a more strongly integrated European ecosystem, the EU can capitalise on the experience, needs, visions, and perceptions of an increasingly diverse range of people, companies and territories. In doing so, it can also take forward a uniquely inclusive European innovation model that is sustainable, guards against substantial labour market and wage gaps, and associated threats to territorial and social cohesion.\nMoreover, such well-connected and diverse ecosystems provide innovative companies with the necessary support and conditions to thrive, i.e. through additional capabilities, data, customers, knowledge, and talents. Network connectivity within and between innovation ecosystems greatly contributes to sustainable business growth with high societal value. Therefore, the actions of this destination aim at strengthening and expanding cooperation between innovation players to better support the next generation of innovative companies whose solutions will lead the shift towards a more competitive EU and a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient world.\nBesides stronger innovation performance, increased competitive sustainability, and more rapid transitions to a green and digital society, ecosystem integration can provide ecosystem actors and companies with access to new resources, markets, customers, and contribute to disruptive and innovative solutions. By being actively engaged in their local, regional, national, and European networks, companies can increase their overall growth potential.\nThis destination offers a holistic package of actions that:\nStrengthen innovation ecosystems across the EU through fostering more efficient, inclusive, gender diverse, and connected innovation ecosystems, by accelerating the development and deployment of innovation, including deep tech[2] innovation and encouraging co-planning, co-implementation, and co-investments around European strategic priority areas;\nEnsure the inclusion of all key innovation players from across the quadruple helix[3], and all EU territories;\nMobilise policies, funding instruments (EU, national, regional) and fostering synergies between them;\nImprove public and private buyers’ capacity to procure innovative solutions and enhance coordination on innovation procurement initiatives within Member States and Associated Countries;\nPromote interregional collaboration and investments with a view to improving territorial cohesion;\nEnsure openness and cross-fertilisation of the innovation ecosystem within and beyond the EU's borders.\nIn particular, the actions under this destination should promote the creation of links:\nEnsure inclusiveness and diversity with the involvement of varied innovation actors from the quadruple helix, for example, individual inventors, industry, startups, scaleups and SMEs investors, innovation hubs, business associations, clusters, public and private buyers of innovative solutions as well as citizens and civil society organisations.\nAmong ‘innovation leaders’ and ‘strong innovators’ with ‘moderate’ and ‘emerging innovators’[4] across the EU and Associated Countries[5] to increase innovation cohesion[6];\nWith networks such as National Contact Points, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), and European Innovation Council (EIC) communities, the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), clusters and Euroclusters, European university alliances, Missions, pan-European platforms such as Startup Europe, public and private regional or local innovation actors, in particular incubators and innovation hubs (e.g. European Research Area hubs and Digital Innovation Hubs);\nInvestEU financial instruments and advisory services bridging access to finance and de-risking projects beyond their upscaling phases, or\nany other EU programme that could interconnect innovators.\nWhere appropriate, the applicants should consider and actively seek synergies with possibilities for further funding from other relevant EU, national and/or regional innovation programmes, including Cohesion Policy funds, the Recovery and Resilience Fund, the EU's External Action instruments, the Growth plan for the Western Balkans[7], the Growth Plan for Moldova[8] and the Ukraine Plan[9], and other public and private funds or financial instruments.\nExpected impact\nProposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to strengthening robust interconnected innovation ecosystems and creating a favourable environment to promote the scalability potential of businesses, including in the deep tech sector, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:\nInterconnected, inclusive, and more efficient innovation ecosystems across the EU that draw on the existing strengths of European, national, regional, and local ecosystems and engage new, less well-represented stakeholders and less advanced innovation territories, including rural areas, to set, undertake, and achieve collective ambitions tackling challenges for the benefit of society, including green, digital, and social transitions, and advancing the European Research Area and the New European Innovation Agenda;\nEnhanced cross-border network connectivity and inter-regional collaboration for better innovation performance in the EU with reinforced connections between more and less innovative regions building on strategic areas of regional strength and specialization to create and renew European value chains in areas most relevant for the sustainable green and digital transition and the EU’s open strategic autonomy, including the five “burning challenges”[10] as defined in the New European Innovation Agenda;\nEnhanced capacity building, experience sharing and cooperation fostering wider implementation of innovation procurement, to shorten the time-to-market for innovative solutions that respond to concrete procurement needs and societal challenges.\nIncrease innovation co-investments, fostering synergies and other funding leverages;\nImproved innovation policy coordination and networking activities of the Member States and Associated Countries through the EIC Forum.\n[1] A New European Innovation Agenda, COM(2022) 332 final\n[2] Deep tech is referring to technology that is based on cutting-edge scientific advances and discoveries and is characterised by the need to stay at the technological forefront by constant interaction with new ideas and results from the lab. “Deep tech” is distinct from ‘high tech’ which tends to refer only to Research & Development intensity.\n[3] A model of cooperation between industry, academia, civil society and public authorities, with a strong

            "**Our software supply chains are a silent miracle**: , the result of millions of hours spent every year packaging, compiling and distributing software. From this vast firehose of bits come the apps and services we depend on every day. Subsequently, billions of hours are spent by users on dealing with everything from simple updates to complex system administration. This vast effort is necessary to keep oneself abreast of the never-ending supply of potential vulnerabilities that arrives with just a slight delay. Users that fail to responsively track new releases of every deployed service and each of its dependencies, are bound to land themselves or others in trouble sooner rather than later.\nDeploying internet based services is much tougher than we can afford. No matter how user friendly or well-written software is, enabling the community at large to maintain internet services by themselves at scale has proven to be consistently challenging. Achieving high availability scenario's is even more of a dark art. No wonder, people just give in and surrender their data.\nFediversity is a comprehensive effort to bring easy-to-use, hosted cloud services with service portability and personal freedom at their core to everyone. It wants to provide everyone with high-quality, secure IT systems for everyday use. Without tracking, without exploitation, in a way that runs everywhere and scales effortlessly. Fediversity is based on NixOS, a disruptive Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager, NixOS is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many other advantages. Because it is reproducible, it is ideally suited for complex deployment scenario's where consistent behaviour, stability and configurability matter.\nOne such \"complex\" deployment scenario is running state-of-the-art services for the Fediverse, like PeerTube, Mastodon, Owncast or Lemmy — especially if you want to for instance add services like live chat or transcoding. But even running more traditional services like modern e-mail servers with possible whistles and bells can be daunting. The same holds for deploying a VPN, private cloud storage, wiki, etc. Fediversity will enable all of these use cases, and more — finally bringing these to the market in a way that is as conveient as using a hosted service.\nFediversity will deliver an ambitious development effort, but this is a vast domain with many more challenges than what any preconceived effort could tackle by itself. This is why we invite your contribution to help us reshape the state of play, and together create an open, trustworthy and reliable internet for all.\nThis is your opportunity to make a real difference. You tell us how your project can help Fediversity go harder, better, faster, stronger. In order to enable you to make such contributions, we will award 450 000 euro in small to medium-size R&D grants towards solutions that bring the next generation of mobile solutions closer. We are seeking project proposals between 5.000 and 50.000 euro's — which should get you on your way. If the project works out well you can subsequently scale up in other programmes funded by NLnet such as NGI0 Commons Fund. Noteworthy fact: many projects which are to be deployed inside Fediversity were themselves bootstrapped on precisely such a grant from NGI, and now it is your turn.",

            "**software**: NGI0 Commons Fund, co-funded from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101135429, foresees as an eligible activity the provision of financial support to third parties, as a means to achieve the objectives of the Next Generation Internet initiative and to contribute to a resilient, trustworthy and sustainably open internet.\n\nIt is clear that the commons model works, and continues to gain ground. Free and open source  and hardware, open standards, open data & AI, open science, creative commons and open educational resources are democratising innovation and learning, and are together driving society and industry forward at an unprecedented pace. But it is also obvious that there are major gaps that need to be fixed still. The answer to market failure and dystopian runaway technology lies in collective action and public investment.\n\nThis is where NGI Zero Commons Fund come into play. The goal of this new fund is to help deliver, mature and scale new internet commons across the whole technology spectrum, from libre silicon to middleware, from P2P infrastructure to convenient end user applications. We have a holistic, full-stack approach, simply because there is no other way. If we want to reclaim the public nature of the internet and yield the full benefits from technology as a society, we need to have full coverage — period.\n\nOnly though enough critical mass of shared building blocks and collective resources will our governments, businesses and civil society be able to secure their security and long term operational availability. The same approach that empowers individuals to take full control of their digital lives, will also steer towards more fair, innovative economies and societies. So let's make it happen!\n\nThe changes we want to see are vast, and there is much technical debt to resolve as well. We are looking for troubleshooters that help society tackle the hard but very very important challenges ahead. Ultimately we believe in the power of the quadruple helix — the collaboration of the public sector, aligned companies, academia and civil society — to restore the internet (and our economies) back to health. Together we can create a strong and open internet for all, and bring about new paradigms like the European Commissions vision for Web 4.0 which aim to harness upcoming techologies like virtual and augmented reality, generative AI and intelligent mediators in a responsible way so they may sustainably serve society.\n\nWe need new ideas and disruptive technologies, while at the same time evolving and growing existing technologies that are still future-proof.\n\nHave a look at other NGI Zero programmes to see the kind of efforts we mean, but don't be afraid to send something completely different if you think you can contribute to the topic — it really is an open call.\n\nProject results always become available under a free or open source license, so anyone can read and validate the source code, and anyone can use the code or open data to create solutions that fits their own purposes. The right to reuse and right to repair not only allow for unrestricted scrutiny and permission-free innovation, but also help to reduce e-waste. And the use of standards enables interoperability and redundancy in implementation to reduce the risk of compromise and failure.\n\nNGI0 Commons Fund is made possible with financial support from the European Commission's Next Generation Internet programme, under the aegis of DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology.\nAdditional funding is made available by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI).",

Project proposals should be in line with the NGI vision and should have research and development as their primary objective. Proposals should be complete and concise (no longer than the equivalent of two pages for the main application, see the submission form). Proposals should have a clear European dimension.\n\nProjects are scored on a 7 point scale on three criteria: technical merit (30% weight), strategic relevance to the Next Generation Internet and expected contribution to the goals of NGI TALER (40% weight) and overall value for money (30% weight). The key objective is to deliver potential break-through contributions to the objectives of NGI TALER and the introduction of privacy-preserving and libre digital payment methods at internet scale. Projects will need a total weighted score above 5.0 (out of 7) in order to be selected.\n\nThe following types of activities qualify for financial support, provided they are cost effective and have a clear link to the topics directly relevant to NGI TALER and the objectives set out in the call:\n\nscientific research\ndesign and development of open source software and open hardware\nvalidation or constructive inquiry into existing or novel technical solutions\nsoftware engineering aimed at adapting to new usage areas or improving software quality\nformal security proofs, security audits, setup and design of software testing and continuous integration\ndocumentation for researchers, developers and end users, including educational materials\nstandardisation activities, including membership fees of standards bodies\nunderstanding user requirements and improving usability/inclusive design\nnecessary measures in support of (broad)er deployability, e.g. packaging\nparticipation in technical, developer and community events like hackathons, IETF, W3C, RIPE meetings, FOSDEM, etc. (admission fee, travel and subsistence costs)\nother activities that are relevant to adhering to robust software development and deployment practices\nproject management\nout-of-pocket costs for infrastructure essential to achieving the above\n\nAll scientific outcomes must be published as open access, and any novel software and hardware created is to be be published under a recognised free and open source license in its entirety.",

When interacting with the offline economy comes into play, the alternative of paying with all kind of volatile cryptocurrencies isn't a viable option either.\n\n is a project funded by the European Commission and the Swiss State to roll out a new electronic payment system that benefits everyone: people, merchants, banks, financial authorities, auditors and anti-corruption researchers. The project doesn't have to start from scratch either, but builds on the strong foundations of GNU Taler — the privacy-preserving digital payment system developed by the GNU community and Taler Systems SA. This offers privacy for those that make payments, while enforcing transparency on those that sell. By providing micro payments at very low overhead, GNU Taler permits internet business models to shift away from advertising revenue or subscription models, especially for online publishers. No-risk transactions can lower transaction fees and open online payments for the underbanked population and citizens marginalized from digitalisation.\n\nPart of the budget of  (15% to be precise) is reserved for open calls to fund additional free and open source efforts that are aligned with the topics and approach of . We invite your contributions to help reshape the state of play of digital payment systems, and to help create an open, trustworthy and reliable internet for all. Of course you can contribute exciting new capabilities to GNU Taler itself, build auxiliary tools or work on user experience, but you could also be developing integrations into FOSS applications and open standards (enabling P2P micropayments in for instance an instant messenger, open social media platform or video conferencing tool), or work on improvements to infrastructure components like merchant backends. Together with the rest of the Next Generation Internet initiative, we move towards restoring and subsequently maintaining European sovereignty and to secure democratic ownership of our digital societies.\n\nIn order to enable you to make such contributions, we will award up to 396 000 euro in small to medium-size R&D grants towards technology commons that empower users, and establish a new generation of privacy-friendly digital payments systems. The programme will run between now and November 2026, but budgets are limited — so grab your opportunity.\n\nProject results must be made available under a free and open source license, so anyone can read and validate the source code, and anyone can use the code to create technology that fits their own purposes. We are seeking project proposals between 5.000 and 50.000 euro's — if the project works out well you can subsequently scale up in other programmes funded by NLnet such as NGI0 Commons Fund. Reliable, low-cost, secure and resource efficient payments should become the 'new normal' of the internet, something ordinary users should not have to worry about — users should be in control. So let's make it happen. Note that GNU Taler itself was funded through such Next Generation Internet projects, so there is every opportunity to grow.\n\nThrough the open calls, we assist independent researchers and developers to join in and create powerful new technologies and put these in the hands of future generations as building blocks for a fair and democratic society. Help us build a sustainable and open economy that benefits all, and submit your idea today. Not sure whether your idea fits?

            "Scope:\nBackground and scope\nLand based agricultural production is the source of approximately 95% of human food nutrients (UN FAO). Intensive and often inappropriate practices in agriculture have however resulted in severe soil degradation, thereby reducing the capacity of soils to support food production and other important ecosystem services such as the regulation of water, nutrients, and carbon cycles. Soil degradation is further accelerated by the effects of climate change, with abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, salinity, and waterlogging, often in combination, having negative effects on the world’s crop production. The direct impact of a changed climate is also frequently accompanied by indirect impacts due to alterations in the composition and behaviour of weeds, insects, pathogens, and soil microbiome, alongside the impacts of increased amounts of human-generated pollutants.\nPlants react to such stresses with what are often conflicting physiological and metabolic responses. These may prioritise one acclimatisation/adaptation strategy over the other, a blend of one or more responses, and/or through developing a completely new strategy, all of which can, in turn, impact final production including nutrient content.\nWhen combined with an increasing human population, likely to increase net demand for food, there is a clear rationale to reinforce existing food and nutrient production systems and explore complementary routes to food production that are more efficient, resilient, sustainable and maintain or increase biodiversity.\nThis Pathfinder Challenge therefore aims to support projects that enhance adaptation pathways for the production of climate-resilient crops and develop alternative pathways to produce high value ingredients in plants by increasing nutrient profile of crops based on plant native and/or non-native ingredients.\nSpecific Objectives\nInnovative ideas put forward under this Challenge must go beyond incremental changes to the state-of-the-art and result in novel production processes that must deliver energy- and resource-efficient, low emission foods that maintain or increase biodiversity and are integral to a healthy diet.\nFunded projects are expected to develop breakthrough technologies that reach TRL4 (validation in laboratory environment) with viable plants at the end of the projects. The proposals should work on both the following objectives:\n• Increasing plant growth, yields and resistance to stress through:\no Enhancing tolerance to stress combinations occurring due to different climate scenarios that include the simultaneous exposure of crops to different stresses e.g. heat combined with drought, salinity, flooding, high CO2 levels, as well as indirect effect of climate change via altered composition and behaviour of weeds, insects, pathogens and soil microbiome and possible impact of human-generated pollutants.\no Increasing water use efficiency and nutrient use efficiency compared to current crops in commercial use.\no Improving plant reproduction and seed filling processes under unfavourable conditions caused by combination of at least two stress factors.\no Investigating and enhancing plant and soil microbiome interactions.\n• Substantially increasing the nutritional value (e.g. proteins, vitamins) in crops through plant native and non-native ingredients in crops.\nProjects must also develop a complete methodology for assessing the increase of plant growth, yields, and climate resilience to single and multiple stresses, and/or assess changes to the nutritional value of crops, as appropriate. Proposals should include multi-omics approaches including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and phenomics. These approaches can be further underpinned by leveraging technologies such as, but not limited to nanoparticle technology, chemistry, and advanced artificial intelligence to develop and introduce novel defence and acclimation strategies, currently not present in crops to achieve greater tolerance to harsh environmental conditions and/or biomanufacturing of non-native ingredients, to enable the time required for that development to be significantly shortened. Proposals should also look to address the narrow genetic diversity of novel crops and are also expected to consider regulatory aspects and to build on the work carried out so far by the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA), where appropriate.\nExpected Outcomes and Impacts:\nIn support of Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU, the Mission Soil, the EU Green Deal, Farm to Fork strategy, the Nature Restoration Law, Fit for 55, and REPowerEU policy actions, the key overall goal of this Challenge is to support the production of sustainable and nutritious food from plants.\nThis Challenge aims to support the development of climate smart crops and the production of high value plant native and non-native ingredients in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner. In the medium to long-term this will:\n• Improve the sustainability, efficiency, biodiversity and resilience of the European food supply chain.\n• Secure long-term competitiveness of EU Food supply chain while decreasing EU dependency on imports of inputs for primary production, feed, and food.\nThe following principles will be used to select the portfolio of projects:\nSelected projects for the portfolio should have a synergy with one another in terms of a common component, for instance projects address similar stress factors for different crops or are leveraging a similar technology.\nA balanced representation of native and non-native ingredients.\nA balanced representation of conventional and New Genomic Techniques (NGTs).\nDiverse type of crops to ensure that the portfolio covers a broad spectrum, if possible, ensuring European geographical coverage where these crops are grown.\nDiverse stress factor combinations to ensure that a broad spectrum of stress factors is covered.\nDiversity in technological approaches to compare their efficiency.\nAll projects will participate in a work package dedicated to the development of monitoring and prediction methodologies for climate adaptation assessment and lifecycle-analysis.

            "Scope:\nBackground and scope\nFossil fuels supply a majority of the world’s energy and also provide the raw materials, or feedstocks, for many essential everyday products. While energy provision is becoming increasingly decarbonized, the production of fuels, chemicals and materials requires carbon atoms as feedstocks. However, their production can be “de-fossilized”, by utilising renewable energy and alternative carbon sources. Likewise, a circular economy approach offers scope to reduce external dependencies and source other essential molecular feedstocks including critical raw materials from wastes.\nThis Pathfinder Challenge therefore focuses on the development of next generation technologies that turn today’s problematic waste streams into essential building blocks of a future circular economy. Furthermore, it specifically focusses on currently non- or hard-to-recycle types of synthetic polymer materials (including among other mixtures of different types of plastics, polymeric composite materials, micro-/nanoplastics, untreated plastic waste, diapers, rubber, etc.), flue gases, wastewater and seawater desalination brines. Proposals must target real-life industrial and household waste streams where current recycling methods face insurmountable barriers e.g., due to impurities, the presence of noxious additives, inseparable material mixtures or nonbiodegradable materials. An important side effect is the remediation of waste streams with respect to micro-/nanoplastics, trace metals and noxious substances. These novel technologies should be scalable, easily applicable and deliver products with higher economic value as compared to waste destruction.\nThe scope of technological solutions addressed in this Challenge is limited to the following technologies with currently low Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), where significant synergies by working in a Challenge portfolio are expected: solar reforming and synthetic biology devices, brine mining and integrated capture and conversion technologies. Microbial-based and photocatalytic remediation processes are included as well. Computational material science and AI, and bottom-up synthetic biology are supported as key enablers at the fundamental research level.\nThermochemical approaches (such as pyrolysis or gasification) and “dark” (not lightdriven) chemical recycling are out-of-scope of this Pathfinder Challenge. Likewise, food and biomass waste, traditional bulk metal waste, glass, paper, cardboard and mono-PET waste are also out of scope.\nSpecific objectives\nThe Challenge seeks ambitious proposals that address one (and only one) of the following focus areas:\nArea 1: Fully integrated waste-to-value devices\nThis includes 1) devices for converting waste streams into (feedstock for) fuels, chemicals and materials and 2) devices for remediation; where processes are solely driven by renewable energy sources (preferably directly by sunlight) and focus on the selective production of added value products, beyond hydrogen as the sole end product:\nFully integrated solar reforming or synthetic biology devices, enabling the treatment of synthetic polymer materials, while delivering fast and efficient decomposition under sustainable reaction conditions (including the use of process chemicals).\nIntegrated capture and conversion technologies, capturing and converting feedstock from flue gases, or wastewater in a single step/ single device into fuels, chemicals and materials, providing increased energy- and materials efficiency as compared to not fully integrated process chains.\nMembrane-based and electrochemical brine mining technologies recovering raw materials, CO2 and water from seawater desalinisation brines.\nEx-situ remediation devices based on microbial/enzymatic and/or photocatalytic degradation, both purifying wastewater and seawater of noxious substances, metals, or nano-/microplastics, and producing added value remediation products. This should take place in a reactor, not in the open field.\nProposals addressing only parts of the full waste-to-value process (e.g., half reactions) will not be considered. Integrated hybrid approaches, at the interface of various disciplines, and autonomously operating devices continuously optimized with AI, are particularly welcome. The resulting devices must reach TRL 4 within the 3–4-year project lifetime.\nThe associated processes must not down-cycle the waste substrate but create products of higher economic and environmental value as compared to the initial waste stream. They must be energy and material-efficient and fully sustainable, minimising the associated energy, water, chemicals and land footprint. Operating conditions (e.g., related to temperature, pressure and the use of additional chemicals) should be optimised and the circular use of process consumables, such as water, catalyst materials or chemical additives maximised. They must deploy environmentally safe, stable materials, with non-toxic degradation products and the developed devices must be recyclable-by-design.\nProposals must take a holistic view of the complete waste valorisation chain by optimising the different elements (pre-treatment, conversion, product separation and storage) with respect to one another. The systems must also be robust and easy-to-handle to allow operations that are independent from large-scale infrastructures, with extended lifetimes and a capability to treat real-life waste streams which have undergone minimal sorting and pre-treatment.\nProposals have to clearly indicate how the proposed solution benchmarks against industrially deployed recycling methods such as mechanical recycling, composting, biogas fermentation or waste-to-energy technologies, and emerging recycling methods such as chemical recycling or thermochemical approaches.\nArea 2: Understanding underlying mechanisms by means of computational material science and AI\nProjects in this focus area must deliver advances and scientific breakthroughs in the fundamental understanding of the underlying physical, chemical, and biological processes that will enable fully sustainable and scalable waste-to-value devices. Projects should address all the following specific objectives:\n- Explore fundamental phenomena crucial to multiple waste-to-value device types, such as the development of efficient, stable and inexpensive catalysts, interface engineering and the effect of the surrounding medium.\n- Develop more accurate and less resource-intensive quantum mechanical and AI methods to guide, predict and interpret reliably experimental works.\n- Bridge the scales from describing properties at the atomic, mesoscopic level up to the macroscopic device level within a multiscale approach and describe phenomena over different timescales.\n- Adopt a holistic approach to exploring phenomena applicable to multiple waste-to-value device types (aligned with Area 1). Devices stemming from Area 1 should serve to validate the developed theoretical models.\nArea 3: Cells from scratch by means of bottom-up synthetic biology\nProjects in this area must look to deliver scientific breakthroughs in bottom-up synthetic biology to enable the use of tailored microbial cell factories for the degradation and valorisation of waste and the production of fossil-free fuels, chemicals, and materials. Projects should address all the following specific objectives:\n- Develop synthetic, fully artificial cells for future large-scale biotechnology applications, tailored to deliver desired functionalities such as carbon fixation or synthetic polymer decomposition.\n- Engineer cell-like systems to produce compounds from abundantly available building blocks, such as water and carbon oxides.\n- Engineer cell-like systems to decompose diverse types of waste, in particular synthetic plastic waste, into compounds that are valorisable as feedstock for a downstream production of fuels, chemicals and materials. At this stage, systems will not have to be completely autonomous and self-replicating, but the integration of different modules should be implemented.\nExpected outcomes and impacts\nThis Challenge is in line with REPowerEU and Fit for 55. It is compliant with the Renewable Energy Directive, the Waste Framework Directive and the Critical Raw Materials Act. It supports the EU’s Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) and the herein included Plastics strategy. It builds on the Industrial Carbon Management strategy, the Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles, and the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources.\nThe portfolio of projects selected under this Challenge are expected to collectively cover Areas 1, 2 and 3. A maximum of one proposal from each of Areas 2 and 3 will be selected, whereas the aim for Area 1 is to select proposals that cover as many device categories (i-iv) as possible. Combining these three aspects into a single portfolio with close interaction between the projects and a commonly developed vision is expected to significantly speed up the innovation journey by driving synergies and mutual learning.\nThe resulting portfolio of projects will in time contribute to:\n- Local energy and resource supply, allowing communities and remote areas to have access to reliable and sustainable waste recycling, supporting the local production of fuels, chemicals and materials. Reduction/ eventual independence from the importation of critical raw materials in the context of increasing demand for such materials for renewable energy and fuel technologies.\n- Increased share of recycled waste, minimizing waste disposal in open dumps, landfills and incineration and the related negative impacts on our environment.\n- Micro-/nano plastic removal, towards a zero-brine discharge.\n- Decentralised, circular production of fuels, chemicals and materials where waste serves as an indispensable local resource enabling on-site production replacing fossil resources. Reduction in the demand for fossil fuels alongside associated CO2 and pollutant emissions reductions. Show less"

            "Scope:\nBackground and scope\nRobotic automation offers significant advantages to several sectors, yet on-site construction robotics is amongst the most challenging and least understood fields in robotics. The unstructured, dynamic environment with human presence makes navigation and automation of the many concurrent construction tasks deeply challenging. Further, the current state-of-the-art solutions focus on adding higher degrees of automation to legacy tools, such as heavy equipment designed for diesel engines and human operators.\nRadical innovations are essential for the sector to address the unprecedented wave of building growth, especially in the context of labour shortages, a productivity gap between the construction and other industries, rising expectations for occupational health and safety, and the need for healthier and more affordable living environments.\nThrough the collaboration of multiple agents (both humans and machines) construction processes can be accelerated, enabling more complex processes with multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously and collaboratively. Multi-robotic collaboration, where robotic agents support and complement each other’s tasks and skill sets within the same workspace, may unlock entirely new processes that are not possible using single robotic machines. This approach could involve multiple distributed “swarms” of collaborative robots using distributed control algorithms and robot learning systems, which may be better suited to large, spatially distributed tasks and can adapt to unpredictable environments. Doing so while also supporting the electrification of the (legacy suite of) construction equipment, will help break with the need to go for ever larger machines and facilitate the development of novel technologies that enable efficient accurate and reliable control, and the adoption of collaborative robots that are suitable for commercial on-site construction environments.\nRealising the disruptive potential of novel emerging technology paradigms that reconsider construction processes from the fundamentals can help supplant and substitute the legacy suite of tools with novel autonomous collaborative construction robots in an integrated, “designed-for-robotics” digital production and assembly chain.\nSuch developments could also further enhance an emerging paradigm shift from today’s complex mix of on-site construction tasks, towards a future of off-site fabrication and on-site assembly. Off-site fabrication offers industrial economic advantages of producing modularized building elements at scale in a controlled, digitalized and automated factory environment. For the construction sector this paradigm shift can deliver demand-side emissions reductions, by implementing strategies of digitalized structural efficiency and novel materials, as well as of zeroemission construction sites through electrification.\nThis Pathfinder Challenge aims to address all construction tasks typically required for site preparation, substructure, and superstructure, as well as the coordination between 43 these tasks to support a transition towards building with autonomous electrified construction equipment. It includes the role of human agents in construction processes, as even high degrees of multi-robotic autonomy with low degrees of supervision will require a collaborative connection between human and robotic agents, ensuring they can safely collaborate and share the same workspace.\nSpecific objectives\nThe overall objective of this Challenge is the development of breakthrough technologies in the domain of autonomous collaborative on-site construction robots for an integrated, designed-for-robotics, digital production and assembly chain.\nThe Challenge is open to the 3 main construction tasks applied to the 2 main construction segments of buildings and infrastructure. Innovative application in adjacent construction segments (for example coastal protection foundations for energy infrastructure) also fall within scope.\nEach funded project shall deliver the following 3 specific objectives:\nObjective 1:\nDevelopment of a simplified structural, load-bearing, material-robot building system to assemble a representative and future-relevant structure (pavilion) using a multitude of discrete modules (elements, segments, blocks, voussoirs). This system must demonstrate TRL4 (validation in laboratory environment) of the autonomous collaborative multirobotic assembly. The structure can represent an infrastructure (for example a bridge, tunnel, culvert, conduit), a building (for example a tower, vault, dome, arch, multi-story skeleton, wall) or other construction elements (for example a foundation, secant wall, barrier, sea wall). The building system can also integrate unprocessed and pre-processed in-situ building materials (rocks, sand, natural materials, demolition materials, disassembled elements). Projects are expected to demonstrate the technologies at least at a relevant human scale in terms of volume, mass and moment of inertia, and ideally at a larger real-world architectural scale, rather than at a laboratory desktop scale.\nSolutions are expected to incorporate “design-for-robotic-assembly” aspects, such as the robot-material interfaces, module interfaces and connectors, and may include innovative approaches such as embedded sensing in the modules.\nA virtual simulation of the disassembled state, various intermediate assembly stages (including temporary (robotic) support measures if necessary) and final assembled state is expected to be part of the systems development process. The project should include a documented validation of key design decisions (for example materials used 44 or configurations that simulate scaled behaviour) against the minimal requirements of the TRL4 demonstration objectives of the autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative platform.\nObjective 2:\nDevelopment of an autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative platform using at least two, preferably more, mutually aware collaborative robotic systems specifically designed for the assembly tasks outlined in Objective 1. This objective requires a structured systems engineering approach to conduct a thorough functional system analysis and to allocate system-level functions between humans and machines within the target autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative platform.\nThe design should include the definition of system states and modes, along with the transitions between them, to ensure safe autonomous operations and effective demonstration of robot-robot and human-robot collaborations and interactions (passive, active, adaptive) at TRL4.\nThe project should also describe how the proposed technology can be scaled to meet the full dimensions of the intended commercial application in future.\nUtilizing existing industrial robots or modifying suitable existing construction tools is allowed. However, these approaches may face workspace limitations when scaled to full commercial dimensions. Conversely, novel relative multi-robotic platforms could make full use of the opportunities of the material-robot system independent of scaling limitations in future.\nObjective 3:\nAchieve a TRL4 demonstration of an autonomous assembly sequence using the demonstration building system developed in Objective 1, executed by the autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative platform developed in Objective 2. The demonstration of a subsequent disassembly sequence is optional but encouraged if the building system is designed for disassembly. The demonstration will take place in a laboratory environment, including tests that explore the system’s resilience and limits under controlled unstructured real-world conditions (for example fault tolerance, granular uneven surfaces, environmental obstacles). These tests aim to identify key weaknesses and recommend future technology developments.\nThe specific objective of this challenge is to advance the digitalized chain of off-site modular production with on-site autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative assembly. Therefore, on-site 3D-printing of cementitious materials or polymers as a primary construction task is outside the scope of this challenge.\nExpected Outcomes and Impacts:\nThis Challenge contributes to the European Green Deal, the European AI Strategy, and the key strategic orientations of Horizon Europe for the digital and green transitions of the construction sector. The anticipated impacts of this Challenge include addressing likely shortages and competition in the labour markets, enhancing productivity and competitiveness within the construction industry, and improving worker safety. It will facilitate a shift towards offsite industrial fabrication coupled with onsite assembly and disassembly, reducing emissions from on-site construction activities, and lowering costs and mitigating risks associated with construction projects. This Challenge will also serve as a lighthouse for industrialization in important policy areas, such as affordable housing, the renovation wave, circular construction, and infrastructure development.\nThe field of mobile construction robotics, in particular heterogeneous collaborative robots assembling discrete building elements, is challenging and multi-disciplinary. Given the nascent state of the enabling technologies, the cumulative impact of the portfolio of Pathfinder projects is expected to surpass that of individual projects. Consortia will benefit from mutual learning and the exchange of approaches and expertise in areas such as mapping, navigating and building awareness of unstructured environments, force-aware manipulation, swarm collectives, as well as commercialisation pathways.\nFurthermore, consortia will be encouraged to collaborate on developing performance metrics and communicate their outputs to the broader public with a view to accelerating the adoption of these radical innovations by the sector. Such valuable joint portfolio activities are anticipated to be discussed and agreed upon by the funded projects.\nThe portfolio of projects selected will aim to cover a complementary set of projects that span the “application” and “approach” fields specified below and combinations thereof:\n- Applications fields (super-structure, sub-structure, site-preparation, building, infrastructure, other construction, target type of environment).\n- Approach (type of robot, number of agents, coordination strategy, level of autonomy, strategy for stability during assembly sequence, multi-modal sensors, resilience strategy for environmental variability, type of discrete building elements and fixations, level of integration of material-robot system).\nSpecific conditions\nApplications for this Challenge with elements that concern the evolution of European communication networks (5G, post-5G and other technologies linked to the evolution of European communication networks) will be subject to restriction for the protection of European communication networks (see Annex II – Section B1) Show less"

            "Scope:\nBackground and scope\nImaging is a crucial component of cancer clinical protocols, providing detailed morphological, structural, metabolic, and functional information. However, harnessing the full potential of the data generated through medical imaging in clinical settings remains challenging. Clinicians often struggle to combine diverse and large-scale data into a comprehensive view of patient care, disease progression, and treatment efficacy. The inability to seamlessly integrate and interpret diverse data sources result in suboptimal patient outcomes and inefficiencies in the delivery of healthcare.\nThe integration of traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) with medical imaging can transform healthcare, but most existing applications are still in their infancy and must overcome a number of challenges to accelerate adoption. These include AI applications being confined to single data modalities, which restricts their overall effectiveness (Monomodal Application); inadequate and insufficient data training, leading to data scarcity and a lack of generalizability, making them less reliable across diverse patient populations, including with regard to gender-sensitivity; and the lack of AI model interpretability, as many AI systems function as \"black boxes,\" providing little insight into their decision-making processes. This lack of transparency limits trust in the systems and their usability in clinical settings.\nThe goal of this Pathfinder Challenge is to create interactive GenAI autonomous agents and/or a combination of them (super-agent) that provide clinicians with a holistic end to end perspective of patient care, throughout the entire clinical pathway. These agents aim to enhance pattern identification, reduce inconsistencies and errors in diagnoses as well as improve cancer treatment. While the focus is on GenAI, we also encourage the integration of other advanced AI technologies, such as topological and geometric deep learning, neural fields, graph neural networks, etc., which can complement and enhance the robustness and effectiveness of GenAI-based solutions in addressing the challenges of cancer diagnosis and therapy.\nThe Challenge will support early-stage groundbreaking research projects that will develop and validate novel approaches and concepts for integrating and interpreting multimodal medical imaging and health data. Additionally, it will involve generating reliable synthetic medical data, which will also be pooled to form a common database and used for the development of advanced algorithms.\nSpecific Objectives\nProject proposals under this Challenge should focus on one (and only one) of the following diseases: breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, stomach cancer or colorectal cancer.\nEach proposal should address both the following areas (at least one sub-objective from each of the areas):\nArea 1: Technological area\nGenAI-based tools for Integrating Multidimensional Multimodal health Data\nInvestigate groundbreaking techniques and methodologies for developing GenAI algorithms that combine multidimensional (e.g. time dimension, space dimension) and multimodal data from various sources. These include multiple imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, PET, X-ray), clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, lab results, structured and unstructured clinical data, pathology results, genetics and – omics data, videos, knowledge databases, and other resources). The goal is to provide a comprehensive view of the patient’s condition. The developed algorithms should be capable of producing unified and actionable datasets that can be exploited for the development of the AI tools described in Area 2 (clinical).\nMedical Data Augmentation\nDevelop GenAI models based on groundbreaking techniques that are in the conceptual or initial experimental phase for medical data augmentation. These models should be capable of creating highly realistic synthetic medical data (images, genomics data, etc.) and generating complementary data from existing sources (for example producing synthetic CT images from MRI images), to support iterative cycles of model training.\nMedical Knowledge Representation and Integration\nCreate an initial prototype GenAI model for medical knowledge representation and integration. This model should aim to develop a comprehensive and dynamic medical knowledge base, to identify discrete medical imaging features associated with demographic information and systemic conditions, to improve the interpretability of AI-based models and extract new knowledge not previously identifiable by experts without assistance.\nArea 2: Clinical Area\nPredictive Diagnosis\nDevelop an interactive autonomous agent capable of assessing the likelihood of a patient developing cancer by analysing their medical history, imaging data, and genetic information. The agent should provide personalised health risk predictions, enabling early detection and preventive measures.\nEnhance Personalized Treatment Selection\nDevelop novel AI algorithms and architectures that leverages multidimensional and multimodal data integration, along with synthetic data generation, to predict the optimal treatment pathway for specific patient conditions, as well as to forecast disease progression and treatment efficacy providing a comprehensive view of patient care.\nAppropriate performance metrics should be considered for the continuous evaluation and testing of the scientific and technical robustness (including accurately quantify uncertainties) of all developed algorithms and architectures in Areas 1 and 2. Rigorous testing against diverse datasets is essential to ensure that the models perform reliably across various patient demographics and conditions, thereby reducing the risk of skewed results and ensuring precision from diagnoses to therapy.\nProjects should also conduct proof of concept studies in controlled settings to demonstrate improved and more accurate diagnosis and treatment when compared to current clinical practice. The viability of the developed technologies should be evaluated, guiding further refinement and improvement. For instance, a super-agent could be validated for assisting and/or replacing clinicians through the whole clinical pathway of the patient, providing a holistic view of patient care, that is currently unachievable due to fragmented healthcare systems and associated expertise.\nThe focus should also be on enhancing the interpretability of AI models/agents, making their decision-making processes more transparent and understandable to clinicians. This could involve developing cutting-edge techniques such as causal inference methods, explainable AI frameworks, or novel visualization tools that provide deeper insights into AI decision-making processes.\nThe AI models developed under this Challenge are expected to comply with the EU concept for Trustworthy AI, relevant ethical principles, and the AI Act. In addition to focusing on performance, careful attention must be given to data quality, transparency, privacy, and security.\nProposers are encouraged to leverage the data and tools available in the Cancer Image Europe platform (deployed in the context of the European Cancer Imaging Initiative) for their proposed work. In turn they should contribute the datasets, and developed AI tools and models to the platform under agreed conditions. All datasets produced should be described where possible with metadata records in the EU dataset catalogue of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) using the Health DCAT-AP metadata standard.\nProjects that address only one of the two ‘Areas’ or other cancer types will be considered \"out\" of scope.\nExpected Outcomes and Impacts:\nIn support of the European AI Strategy and the Cancer Plan for Europe and the Cancer Mission this Challenge looks to support the development of the next generation models for cancer diagnosis and treatment, with Generative AI.\nThis Challenge aims to create a collaborative environment where diverse expertise — including for example data science, informatics, oncology, radiology, pathology, medical physics, bioinformatics, geneticists, healthcare administrators, and patient advocacy groups — converges to address the complexities of developing autonomous agents for holistic patient care, through enhanced diagnosis and personalized treatment.\nThe Challenge aspires to significantly improve patient care and reduce pressure on the healthcare system by leveraging advanced interactive autonomous agents for diagnosis and personalized treatment. By alleviating the burdens on clinicians and ensuring compliance with the EU concept for Trustworthy AI, the initiative will enhance the quality and reliability of medical services. Economically, it promises substantial cost reductions and cost avoidance, leading to long-term improvements in healthcare efficiency and sustainability. Ultimately, this challenge will foster innovation and establish Europe as a leader in the field, delivering profound benefits to patients, healthcare providers, and society at large.\nThe portfolio of selected projects will be designed to deliver a set of agents/models for improved diagnosis and personalized treatment of the above-mentioned cancers. Specifically, the projects will collaborate to:\n- Create a shared database of synthetically generated images to be used across all projects for the development of their algorithms;\n- Compare the use of a combination of the agents in the case of multiple cancers;\n- Benchmark agents for enhanced diagnosis and personalized treatment selection;\n- Define innovative clinical pathways in oncology;\n- Externally validate the developed agents within a project at clinical premises of another project in the portfolio;\n- Develop standardized methods and frameworks for evaluating AI- Act and Medical Device Regulation (MDR)- compliant generative AI models.\nThe portfolio of projects to be funded under this Challenge will be composed in such a way that they address ideally all cancers mentioned in this call, apply different technologies, and provide access to relevant clinical facilities and research infrastructures. The following categories will be used for the composition:\nCategory 1 – type of cancer\nCategory 2 – type of technology\nCategory 3 – access to appropriate infrastructure data and ecosystem integration.\nSpecific conditions\nApplications for this Challenge with elements that concern the evolution of European communication networks (5G, post-5G and other technologies linked to the evolution of European communication networks) will be subject to restriction for the protection of European communication networks (see Annex II – Section B1) Show less"

While the available QKD products have now been made available by industry for a market of early adopters and innovators, there is the need to intensify standardization efforts at all levels, from QKD components, systems and applications to network capabilities and components for future quantum networks, to enable integration of quantum devices into wider complex systems, to build a solid industrial base and anticipate foreseeable work on components for future quantum networks and future certification.\nScope:\nScope\nProposals may include the following activities:\nOverview of current QKD standardization activities\nStandardization of QKD components such as, among others, single-photon sources, entanglement-based sources, QKD transmitters/receivers and detectors, ultra-low loss optical fibres. Activities on requirements on the performance of the system, definition of benchmarking tests, the definition of metrics, calibration at operational environment and monitoring of the correct behaviour over the entirely lifetime of the system are encouraged.\nStandardization of multiplexing of quantum signals with third-party classical and noise compensation technology.\nStandardization of software-hardware interfaces, as well as harmonization of interoperable key management system APIs.\nStandardization of systems and applications for the operation of an entire network and multiple networks, covering network capabilities such as routing, control and management capabilities, interoperability between different SDN systems, roaming for cross-border connections.\nStandardization of hybridisation schemes for combined QKD/PQC.\nEvaluation and certification of QKD protocols, via formalization of a rigorous assessment of different types of implementation constraints in the security proofs. Accelerating work on certification, by strengthening interdisciplinary collaboration between national authorities, accredited evaluation laboratories and other relevant initiatives. Show less"

            "**Submission Process:**: UDENE Project is a Research and Innovation Action funded by EUSPA under the Horizon Europe Programme. It leverages Copernicus Earth Observation (EO) data to discover occurrences (natural experiments) of urban development interventions intended for an Area of Interest (AoI) elsewhere in the world, which are similar to the AoI in terms of causally related properties to the intended outcome of the intervention. Existing use cases target the effect of green spaces on urban heat islands, the effect of transportation infrastructure on air quality, and the effect of the built environment on earthquake resilience. By integrating EO data, machine learning, and advanced causal modelling, UDENE provides robust tools enabling evidence-based urban planning and decision-making. The project supports international collaboration, promoting the uptake of Copernicus services through validation of practical urban development solutions across Copernicus International partner countries such as Serbia, Tunisia, and Türkiye.\nPurpose of the Call: To stimulate international business collaboration by integrating UDENE tools into market-driven solutions developed jointly by European Earth Observation based products and services providers and local SMEs or other entities, thereby accelerating global adoption and commercialization of Copernicus Earth Observation-based applications.\nThe Call Specific Objectives: 1) To establish sustainable partnerships between European providers and local entities (in particular SMEs) in Copernicus International Partner countries 2) To demonstrate the commercial viability and scalability of business solutions integrating UDENE tools for urban planning and environmental management. 3) To facilitate knowledge transfer and capacity building, enhancing the capabilities of local entities and SMEs to independently adopt and market Earth Observation-based solutions globally.\nExpected outcomes (applies to all Copernicus International Partner countries): The grant recipients are expected to deliver a feasibility report that provides evidence for the feasibility arguments they have about the business cases they have submitted.

            "Expected Impact:\nThe project is expected to deploy cross-border digital infrastructure that will accelerate the digitalisation of the energy/mobility sector by enhancing interoperability and standardisation and trigger a public-private partnership virtuous circle of investment. To the extent possible, this infrastructure will build on and integrate with existing and emerging European data, cloud and edge computing and connectivity infrastructures. The project should lead to a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) and improvement in the energy and environmental performance of the European energy, transport and digital infrastructures thus addressing and easing the current energy and climate crisis and avoiding blackouts.\nThe key performance indicators for the topic will include the number of connected operators supporting cross-border exchange of data and services, the number of interconnected cross border energy and/or transport systems, the amount of energy saved and the percentage of GHG emission decrease due to cross-border energy and/or transport exchange, as well as the degree of integration with the European data, computing, and connectivity infrastructure both for leveraging digital infrastructure and optimising its energy and environmental performance.\nObjective:\nOperational Digital Platforms aim to support EU environmental and energy targets, improve the competitiveness of the EU industry and address the ongoing energy crisis, by providing both technologies and connectivity to enable a cyber-secure Internet of Energy and an optimised transport system along the major European paths.\nThey are dedicated to “retro-fitting” the existing energy and/or transpor tinfrastructures with the required cross-border digital infrastructure. ODPs will optimise energy use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and reduce the environmental impact, while increasing the benefits enabled by ICT.\nODPs will build on and integrate with existing and emerging European data, cloud and edge computing and connectivity infrastructures, in particular those supported in other parts of the CEF Digital programme, the Digital Europe Programme, and the Horizon Europe programme.\nThe ODPs will contribute to the achievement of EU technological sovereignty and to the security and resilience of energy supply and transports in the EU. This support contributes to the Digital Decade goals such as the deployment of 10,000 climate neutral highly secure edge nodes, etc.\nProjects funded under this call should include specific deliverables, milestones and KPIs related to:\n• Deploying fully functional, cross-border ODPs in line with the description in the scope section;\n• Delivering quantifiable results in terms of CO₂ reduction, energy savings, and grid flexibility;\n• Providing open, standards-based architectures suitable for replication in other Member States, also in line with the vision for an AI-enabled digital spine of the energy and e-mobility system and other EU initiatives;\n• Strengthening collaboration across sectors (energy, transport, ICT) and across borders;\n• Creating new business models for distributed energy resources, smart mobility, and sustainable infrastructure;\n• Improving consumer empowerment, data transparency, and system efficiency.\nScope:\nThe projects supported by this call are expected to deploy cross-border digital infrastructure implementing an AI-Driven Operational Digital Platform (ODP) for Electricity Consumers and Integration of electric vehicles (EV), electric trucks (ET), renewable energy sources (RES) into the Grid. Moreover, the proposed platform could help data centres, which are among the fastest growing energy consumers in Europe, to shift non-critical workloads to times or locations where energy is greener or cheaper and participate in grid services, acting as flexible loads that can ramp up or down to support balancing.\nThe platform must include the maximum number of the following key functionalities:\n• Real-time monitoring and feedback for consumers on energy rate use, carbon footprint, and tariff optimisation;\n• AI-based advisory services, helping users to adjust their behaviours or schedules to match renewable availability.\n• Participation in virtual energy communities (VECs), allowing local prosumers to trade surplus energy or flexibility;\n• Integration of controllable assets such as EV chargers, heat pumps, or batteries to provide demand response;\n• AI-powered charging optimisation, based on traffic, weather, grid conditions, and fleet schedules;\n• Dynamic pricing and congestion signals, ensuring grid-aware energy consumption and EV charging;\n• Smart routing tools for logistics managers, integrating vehicle range, charging station status, and energy prices;\n• Integration of renewable generation (e.g. solar, wind) into vehicle charging plans\n• Support for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations, where EVs can return energy to the grid during peak demand.\nOptional functionalities may include:\n• Participation of data centres in flexibility markets, via dynamic load shifting or reserve services;\n• Data centres workload migration tools, allowing computing tasks to be routed across borders to greener data centres.\nThe evaluation of proposals shall prioritise those offering the higher number of functionalities, as they will be considered as having a higher impact. Such impact will be taken into account when evaluating the proposals under the “Impact” award criterion.\nThe platform should follow a layered digital architecture.\nThe proposed ODP should push the boundaries of energy operations by providing private and industrial players with robust digital tools for cross-border trading, monitoring and ownership management. It should be designed to manage European transport in increasingly automated and sustainable way bringing digitalisation and electrification of the sector to a new level. Its strong focus on AI-driven charging and route planning will provide a transport domain benchmarking.\nThe ODP should follow the BEGONIA project’s guidelines related to the architecture, governance and implementation of ODPs, and other preparation materials for delivering the functionalities.\nPlease consult the call document for more information on the scope, including digital security requirements.

            "Objective:\n2. CERV-2025-CITIZENS-REM-HOLOCAUSTJEW - Strengthening the remembrance of the Holocaust against Jewish people\nThe Shoah is a defining legacy for the EU. Six million Jewish children, women and men were murdered, and all others were persecuted. While other groups were persecuted, the Nazis have set up across Europe and beyond a state policy with the sole aim to kill every single Jews they could find.\nFirst-hand accounts of the Shoah continue to have the most powerful impact on following generations. As there are less and less survivors to share the story of their survival, the importance of memorial sites and education increases, as well as the work done by second and third generations of survivors and associations.\nCurrent events show the growing instrumentalization of the Holocaust by Kremlin propaganda claiming to denazify Ukraine. In parallel, there is also a politicization of the Holocaust in several EU Member States, and a tendency to minimize the atrocities of the Shoah. In addition, since the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas, we have seen a growing conflation of the Shoah with the conflicts in the Middle East. Citizens should be empowered to counter this conflation.\nHolocaust distortion fuels antisemitism. In addition, hate speech relating to the condoning, denial or gross trivialisation of the Holocaust is prohibited under the Council Framework Decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law.\nWounds of mass atrocities of the 20th century are still open today, fuelling divergences among Europeans. Free, open and independent research, education and memory on all aspects of the Shoah is essential to increase understanding. This includes telling the story of collaborators, bystanders, and saviours. This implies exploring Europe’s negative history with the aim to reconcile divergent and alternative regional and national narratives related to the Shoah and its immediate aftermath.\nEuropean citizens should become ambassadors of this memory. Teachers, policy-makers, university students (especially history students) could be among key target audiences and be empowered to develop a common European history, to counter historical falsification, distortion and inversion. Target groups could include newcomers and migrants that do not have a direct link with the Shoah. Target groups could also include journalists, to raise awareness about Holocaust distortion and Holocaust-related contemporary events (such as for example Neo-Nazi marches).\nIn line with the EU Strategy on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life (2021-2030), as well as with other key policy initiatives, this topic supports projects that can focus on developing networks of Young European Ambassadors to promote Shoah remembrance. This topic will also support projects that develop and support networks that use places of memory, ‘where the Holocaust happened’ for educational purposes.\nProjects under this topic could focus on:\nAddressing how the Shoah took place, how the crimes were committed, which actors were involved, the roles of collaborators and bystanders, as well as the roles of saviours and Righteous among the Nations. As well as pre-war and immediate postwar historical developments.\nCountering Holocaust denial, distortion, trivialisation and victims’ inversion. This includes countering false comparisons, conspiracy theories propagated online, and conflation with the Middle East conflict.\nCountering historical falsification and memory competition related to the Shoah, especially among Europeans that shared a common history but have divergent views on their common past.\nAddressing divergent and opposite national historical narratives, on regional basis, of the history of the Shoah, including parallelism with other negative common shared historical regional events.\nPromoting memory activism related to the Shoah including by supporting grassroot commemorative work.\nDigitalising historical material and testimonies of witnesses for education and training purposes.\nMarking International Holocaust Remembrance Day and national Holocaust remembrance days.\nCombating glorification of Nazism, countering neo-Nazis manifestations and activities.\nPromoting provenance research on looted art to foster awareness raising, mutual learning or training activities.\nFor further information about the call and its conditions, please see the Call document.

            "Objective:\n3. CERV-2025-CITIZENS-REM-GENCRIME - Strengthening the remembrance of the Holocaust, genocides, war crimes and crimes against humanity to reinforce democracy in the EU\nProjects under this topic should focus on the non-Jewish victims of the Holocaust, including Roma and LGBTIQ people, as well as other genocides, war crimes and crimes against humanity of the 20th century’s Europe.\nProjects under this topic should NOT address the Holocaust against Jewish people which is covered by Topic 2.\nThe European Union is founded on the principles of human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, and the rule of law. Europe’s 20th century was marked by horrific crimes, genocides including Holocaust, war crimes and crimes against humanity as well as the crimes committed under authoritarian and totalitarian regimes, including those of communist and fascist dictatorships. The remembrance of these gravest crimes committed on European soil plays a critical role in upholding these values.\nStrengthening collective memory of such crimes contributes not only to preventing their recurrence but also to reinforcing democratic resilience, fostering civic engagement, and building a common European culture of remembrance.\nThe legacy of these crimes requires continuous sharing, remembering, teaching as well as research. Education targeting all generations, in particular young people on the importance of safeguarding democracy and fundamental rights should draw on the lessons from these crimes. This also implies countering distortion, denial and trivialisation of the historical facts.\nAmong these atrocities, the Roma Holocaust—often overlooked or insufficiently acknowledged—requires dedicated attention. Remembering the Roma Holocaust (Porajmos) and other genocides is essential not only to honour the victims and survivors but also to address its lasting impact on the situation of Roma today who are significantly lagging behind in all areas of life. The continued presence of antigypsyism and structural discrimination underscores the urgent need to integrate Roma history and memory into broader European narratives. The importance of initiatives raising awareness on the Roma genocide, advancing reconciliation efforts, helping to challenge prejudice is recalled by the EU Roma Strategic Framework and its aligned Council Recommendation.\nDuring the Holocaust, amongst other minorities, LGBTIQ people were also persecuted by the Nazi regime, and were often imprisoned in concentration camps. In addition, many LGBTIQ people suffered severe abuse and forced labour, facing marginalization both during and after the war, with their experiences largely unrecognized for decades. As a result, the history of LGBTIQ persons in Europe is marked by both struggle and resilience, shaped by periods of persecution as well as progress toward equality. The preservation and recognition of LGBTIQ history and memory are essential to building an inclusive European identity rooted in dignity, diversity, and human rights, thus acknowledging their vital role in Europe's democratic and cultural legacy.\nProjects under this topic could focus on:\nAddressing how genocides, including Holocaust, war crimes and crimes against humanity were organised, which actors were involved and how they were committed, the roles of collaborators, perpetrators and bystanders.\nFinding new ways of remembering, educating and teaching about these crimes to protect society against resurging threats of hatred, such as racism, xenophobia, antigypsyism and LGBTIQ phobia. They can include artistic work on Holocaust-related memory projects, as well as stimulating memory activism. These new methods should be inclusive, where applicable participatory and create an enabling learning environment.\nCountering historical falsification and memory competition related to the genocide of the Roma and other genocides, war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially among Europeans that shared a common history but have divergent views on their common past.\nCountering denial, distortion, trivialization, and especially on false comparisons.\nAddressing divergent and opposite national historical narratives, on regional basis, of these darkest hours of Europe history and other negative common shared historical events.\nPromoting memory activism by supporting grassroot commemorative work.\ndigitalising historical material and testimonies of witnesses for education and training purposes.\nFostering intergenerational dialogue by involving young people and older generations in transmitting the memory and understanding.\nEngaging newcomers and migrants and teach about Europe’s history of genocides, including Holocaust, war crimes and crimes against humanity, contributing to a shared understanding of the values underpinning the European Union.\nFoster awareness raising, mutual learning or training activities that accurately reflect the persecution of Roma, LGBTIQ people, and other minorities during the Holocaust and other times in the history.\nFor further information about the call and its conditions, please see the Call document.

            "Objective:\n1. CERV-2025-CITIZENS-REM-TRANSITION - Democratic transition, (re-) building and strengthening society based on the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights\nThe EU is a community of values, and all its Member States committed to respect the principles of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for fundamental rights. Europe's experiences in the 20th century demonstrates the need for resilient democracies and the need for people to actively engage in and protect democratic institutions and values. Historical experience such as in the 1920s and 1930s, when some European democracies went through particularly challenging times, are stark reminders of the importance to promote democracy, also in a historical perspective. Today, democracy faces several challenges, which underlined the need to strengthen public trust in democratic processes and institutions and to recall the importance of democracy in people’s daily life.\nDemocratic transitions (defined as the transition from a non-democratic to a democratic system, a transition undertaken by several European countries before joining the EU) are not only political and legal processes but also societal transformations.The transition and consolidation of democracies through institutional and legal reforms has been essential. In addition, delivering justice to victims and affected communities after the fall of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes (including communist and fascist dictatorships) can aid in societal healing, bolster and reinforce resilience against present and future threats to democracies.\nProjects under this topic can focus on:\nThe ongoing development and nurturing of democracies in the context of past transitions from authoritarian and totalitarian regimes (including communist and fascist dictatorships) across various European countries, reveals important lessons for defending and upholding EU values such as democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights.\nThey can also reflect on both shared patterns and national specificities, while underlining the lasting impact of the totalitarian or authoritarian past and how its difficult legacy continues to be remembered, interpreted, and engaged with today.\nExamining and giving visibility to acts of resistance and organised opposition to past totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, as part of the ongoing effort to nurture and protect democracy in the face of enduring and emerging challenges.\nTransition from authoritarian and totalitarian regimes (including communist and fascist dictatorships) towards democracy.\nPromoting remembrance and education about past events in which fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, assembly, thought, conscience, religion, and electoral rights were suppressed under past totalitarian and authoritarian regimes. These examples serve to reinforce the importance of protecting democratic values today, including the right to express dissenting opinions and ensuring a political space where opposition voices can be freely and safely heard.\nExploring the means of historical justice, be it through trials, restitution or amnesty, and possibility still today to work on restorative justice.\nThe elements described above to strengthen democracies, such as fighting foreign interference, strengthen citizen engagement, critical thinking, media literacy, and societal resilience, are closely related to the context of remembrance, as they help ensure that the dramatic events of the past are not repeated in contemporary Europe.\nFor further information about the call and its conditions, please see the Call document.

            "Objective:\n4. CERV-2025-CITIZENS-REM-HISTMIGRATION - Migration, de-colonisation, slavery and multicultural European societies\nMigration, de-colonisation, enslavement, and imperialism are embedded in the European history, and all have profound consequences for society today.\nMigration has a long and varied history in Europe but is often treated solely as a present- day phenomenon. However, population movements in Europe, from economic, political migration to expulsion and deportation after the Second World War, from fleeing violence and persecution to migration after the creation of the EU, have marked 20th century European history. The specific history of female migration can also be considered. Migration is multi-faceted and the experiences of migration into, out of or within Europe are lessons for future generations.\nForced migration, internal displacement and expulsion is an experience shared by many Europeans during the period of war. This includes the forced displacement and persecution of Roma populations during and after the Second World War, and its long-term consequences.\nThere is a wider acceptance of the need to address the past. The discussion on structural racism including antigypsyism entails an examination of the past, present and future of the cultural fabric of Europe.\nColonialism, slavery, and imperialism have left a mark on global history. Prejudices and stereotypes can be addressed by acknowledging the historical roots of racism, including from an intersectional perspective. De-colonisation, the dismantlement of colonial empires particularly in the 20th century and the emerging post-colonial European societies are shaped by this experience until today. While for many, colonialism is considered a chapter in history, the consequences of imperialistic rule inside and outside Europe are felt still today and are intertwined with structural racism and discrimination. However, these debates have been absent for far too long and need to be firmly embedded in a European narrative. Ensuring remembrance is an important part of encouraging inclusion and understanding.\nFollowing the decolonisation process in international relations in the early 20th century, the UN World Conference on Combating Racism, Racial Discrimination, and Xenophobia established that structural inequalities are caused by the consequences of colonialism and slavery. Stemming from this observation, in its EU Anti-Racism Action Plan 2020-2025, the Commission made efforts to communicate on addressing the historical roots of racism.\nProjects under this topic could focus on:\nExploring the legacy of colonialism and its ongoing impact on contemporary multicultural European societies, with a view to contributing to the objectives of the EU Anti-Racism Action Plan 2020-2025, including addressing topics such as discrimination and racism\nRaising awareness of Roma history and culture to contribute to strengthening multicultural European societies, in line with the EU Roma Strategic Framework for equality, inclusion and participation\nExamining common European experiences of migration linked to historical events such as wars, transition moments, colonisation and de-colonisation, economic impacts, or persecution\nAdopting an intersectional approach to cover several minority groups, including Jews, Roma, Overseas citizens, and other minority groups with a long history of migration, to promote a more nuanced understanding of multicultural European societies.\nFor further information about the call and its conditions, please see the Call document.

It leverages Copernicus Earth Observation (EO) data to discover occurrences (natural experiments) of urban development interventions intended for an Area of Interest (AoI) elsewhere in the world, which are similar to the AoI in terms of causally related properties to the intended outcome of the intervention. Existing use cases target the effect of green spaces on urban heat islands, the effect of transportation infrastructure on air quality, and the effect of the built environment on earthquake resilience. By integrating EO data, machine learning, and advanced causal modelling, UDENE provides robust tools enabling evidence-based urban planning and decision-making. The project supports international collaboration, promoting the uptake of Copernicus services through validation of practical urban development solutions across Copernicus International partner countries such as Serbia, Tunisia, and Türkiye.\n To expand the skilled practitioners of Geodata Science in Copernicus International Partner countries by using UDENE open-source tools as a practice platform in vocational courses.\nThe Call Specific Objectives: 1) To expand the skilled user base of Copernicus Earth Observation System 2) To demonstrate the value of geodata science in public services for maximizing societal impact 3) To enable hands on training by embedding UDENE tools into educational curricula and training programs\nExpected outcomes (applies to all Copernicus International Partner countries): The grant receivers are expected to deliver an educational plan with the following components 1) Curriculum design for geodata science as an applied discipline, 2) Educational modules or course content integrating UDENE tools into practical geodata science curricula, ready to be adopted by vocational and higher educational institutions and/or training programs. 3) Demonstrative case studies suitable for the intended skill levels showcasing the use of UDENE tools and Copernicus products in solving specific urban development challenges relevant to the partner countries.\nSubmission Process: Interested parties can use the guidelines available at the UDENE website Open Calls page to prepare proposals and the winners will be compensated to get to use the UDENE tools in October-November to implement their proposed workplans.\nFunding: There will be two winners per call per country, each of which will receive 10.000€ lump sum funding upon completing their educational plans.\nThe Evaluation Process: The evaluation will be a two-stage process\n        Stage 1 - The Screening Procedure for Eligibility and Feasibility Checklist: SMEs, start-ups, Local authorities, NGOs, Associations, Education and Training Organizations, Research Performing Institutions, individuals, and teams of individuals, based in one of the target countries and as defined in Horizon Europe rules for participation, can be applicants.

            "Expected Impact:\nDuring the programming period 2021-2027, the RFCS will be linked to the objectives of the European Green Deal, which aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use.\nThe Communication also states that all Union actions and policies should pull together to help the Union achieve a successful and just transition towards a sustainable future.\nWithin the European Green Deal objectives, applicants to the RFCS calls should therefore consider the following elements when preparing their proposals:\nA power sector must be developed that is based largely on renewable sources, complemented by the rapid phasing out of coal\nThe EU should also reinforce current initiatives [...] on cross-cutting climate and environment issues. This may include ending global fossil fuel subsidies in line with its G20 commitments, [...] phasing out all new coal plant construction, and action to reduce methane emissions\nFocus on the regions and sectors that are most affected by the transition because they depend on fossil fuels or carbon-intensive processes\nProtect people and workers most vulnerable to the transition, providing access to re-skilling programmes, and jobs in new economic sectors.\nEach proposal shall include an assessment of anticipated industrial, economic, social and environmental benefits (Article 26 of RFCS Regulation “Content of proposals”).\nObjective:\nResearch objectives for coal ( Council Decision 2008/376/EC amended by Council Decision EU 2021/1094 )\nArticle 4 Supporting the just transition of the coal sector and regions\n1. Research projects shall support the transition towards a climate-neutral Union economy by 2050, with the objective of supporting the phasing out of fossil fuels, developing alternative activities on former mine sites and avoiding or addressing the environmental damage from coal mines in the process of closure, formerly operating coal mines and their surroundings. Projects shall in particular focus on:\n(a) the development and testing of carbon dioxide capture, use and storage technologies;\n(b) the use of geothermal energy on former coal sites;\n(c) non-energetic uses and the production of raw materials from mining wastes and residues from formerly operating coal mines or those in the process of closure, while duly ensuring that their climate, environmental and health impact is minimised and lower than alternative solutions;\n(d) the repurposing of former coal and lignite mines as well as coal-related infrastructure, including power supply services, in line with a climate-neutral and environmentally friendly transition;\n(e) the promotion of the development of efficient reskilling and upskilling programmes for workers affected by a coal phase-out, including research on the training and reskilling of workers employed or previously employed in the coal sector.\n2. Special attention shall be given to strengthening European leadership in managing the transition of formerly operating coal mines and coal-related infrastructure through technological and non-technological solutions, while supporting technology and non-technology transfer. Research activities with those objectives shall present tangible climate and environmental benefits in line with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050.\nArticle 5 Improving health and safety\n1. Issues concerning safety in coal mines in the process of closure and formerly operating coal mines with a view to improving working conditions, occupational health and safety, as well as environmental issues deleterious to health, shall be taken into account in the projects covering the activities referred to in Articles 4 and 6.\n2. Research projects shall focus on diseases related to mining activities with the aim of improving the health of people living in coal regions in transition. Research projects shall also ensure protective measures during the closure of mines and in formerly operating mines.\nArticle 6 Minimising the environmental impacts of coal mines in transition\n1. Research projects shall seek to minimise the impacts of coal mines in the process of closure and of formerly operating mines on the atmosphere, water and soils. Research shall be geared towards preserving and restoring natural resources for future generations and minimising the environmental impact of coal mines in the process of closure and in formerly operating mines.\n2. Preference shall be given to projects that envisage one or more of the following:\n(a) new and improved technologies to avoid environmental pollution, including methane leakage, of coal mines in the process of closure, formerly operating mines and their surroundings (including the atmosphere, land, soils and water);\n(b) capturing, avoiding and minimising greenhouse gas emissions, in particular methane, from coal deposits in the process of closure;\n(c) managing and reusing mining waste, fly ash and desulphurisation products from coal mines in the process of closure and formerly operating coal mines, as well as, where relevant, other forms of waste;\n(d) refurbishing waste heaps and using industrially residues from coal production and consumption in coal regions in transition;\n(e) protecting water tables and purifying mine drainage water;\n(f) restoring the environment of former installations or installations that are in the process of closure that used coal, and their surroundings, in particular water, land, soils and biodiversity;\n(g) protecting surface infrastructure against the effects of subsidence and ground movements in the short and long term.

This may include ending global fossil fuel subsidies in line with its G20 commitments, [...] phasing out all new coal plant construction, and action to reduce methane emissions\nFocus on the regions and sectors that are most affected by the transition because they depend on fossil fuels or carbon-intensive processes\nProtect people and workers most vulnerable to the transition, providing access to re-skilling programmes, and jobs in new economic sectors.\nEach proposal shall include an assessment of anticipated industrial, economic, social and environmental benefits (Article 26 of RFCS Regulation “Content of proposals”).\nObjective:\nResearch objectives for coal ( Council Decision 2008/376/EC amended by Council Decision EU 2021/1094 )\nArticle 4 Supporting the just transition of the coal sector and regions\n1. Research projects shall support the transition towards a climate-neutral Union economy by 2050, with the objective of supporting the phasing out of fossil fuels, developing alternative activities on former mine sites and avoiding or addressing the environmental damage from coal mines in the process of closure, formerly operating coal mines and their surroundings. Projects shall in particular focus on:\n(a) the development and testing of carbon dioxide capture, use and storage technologies;\n(b) the use of geothermal energy on former coal sites;\n(c) non-energetic uses and the production of raw materials from mining wastes and residues from formerly operating coal mines or those in the process of closure, while duly ensuring that their climate, environmental and health impact is minimised and lower than alternative solutions;\n(d) the repurposing of former coal and lignite mines as well as coal-related infrastructure, including power supply services, in line with a climate-neutral and environmentally friendly transition;\n(e) the promotion of the development of efficient reskilling and upskilling programmes for workers affected by a coal phase-out, including research on the training and reskilling of workers employed or previously employed in the coal sector.\n2. Special attention shall be given to strengthening European leadership in managing the transition of formerly operating coal mines and coal-related infrastructure through technological and non-technological solutions, while supporting technology and non-technology transfer. Research activities with those objectives shall present tangible climate and environmental benefits in line with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050.\nArticle 5 Improving health and safety\n1. Issues concerning safety in coal mines in the process of closure and formerly operating coal mines with a view to improving working conditions, occupational health and safety, as well as environmental issues deleterious to health, shall be taken into account in the projects covering the activities referred to in Articles 4 and 6.\n2. Research projects shall focus on diseases related to mining activities with the aim of improving the health of people living in coal regions in transition. Research projects shall also ensure protective measures during the closure of mines and in formerly operating mines.\nArticle 6 Minimising the environmental impacts of coal mines in transition\n1. Research projects shall seek to minimise the impacts of coal mines in the process of closure and of formerly operating mines on the atmosphere, water and soils. Research shall be geared towards preserving and restoring natural resources for future generations and minimising the environmental impact of coal mines in the process of closure and in formerly operating mines.\n2. Preference shall be given to projects that envisage one or more of the following:\n(a) new and improved technologies to avoid environmental pollution, including methane leakage, of coal mines in the process of closure, formerly operating mines and their surroundings (including the atmosphere, land, soils and water);\n(b) capturing, avoiding and minimising greenhouse gas emissions, in particular methane, from coal deposits in the process of closure;\n(c) managing and reusing mining waste, fly ash and desulphurisation products from coal mines in the process of closure and formerly operating coal mines, as well as, where relevant, other forms of waste;\n(d) refurbishing waste heaps and using industrially residues from coal production and consumption in coal regions in transition;\n(e) protecting water tables and purifying mine drainage water;\n(f) restoring the environment of former installations or installations that are in the process of closure that used coal, and their surroundings, in particular water, land, soils and biodiversity;\n(g) protecting surface infrastructure against the effects of subsidence and ground movements in the short and long term.

This may include ending global fossil fuel subsidies in line with its G20 commitments, [...] phasing out all new coal plant construction, and action to reduce methane emissions\nFocus on the regions and sectors that are most affected by the transition because they depend on fossil fuels or carbon-intensive processes\nProtect people and workers most vulnerable to the transition, providing access to re-skilling programmes, and jobs in new economic sectors.\nObjective:\nResearch objectives for coal ( Council Decision 2008/376/EC amended by Council Decision EU 2021/1094 )\nArticle 4 Supporting the just transition of the coal sector and regions\n1. Research projects shall support the transition towards a climate-neutral Union economy by 2050, with the objective of supporting the phasing out of fossil fuels, developing alternative activities on former mine sites and avoiding or addressing the environmental damage from coal mines in the process of closure, formerly operating coal mines and their surroundings. Projects shall in particular focus on:\n(a) the development and testing of carbon dioxide capture, use and storage technologies;\n(b) the use of geothermal energy on former coal sites;\n(c) non-energetic uses and the production of raw materials from mining wastes and residues from formerly operating coal mines or those in the process of closure, while duly ensuring that their climate, environmental and health impact is minimised and lower than alternative solutions;\n(d) the repurposing of former coal and lignite mines as well as coal-related infrastructure, including power supply services, in line with a climate-neutral and environmentally friendly transition;\n(e) the promotion of the development of efficient reskilling and upskilling programmes for workers affected by a coal phase-out, including research on the training and reskilling of workers employed or previously employed in the coal sector.\n2. Special attention shall be given to strengthening European leadership in managing the transition of formerly operating coal mines and coal-related infrastructure through technological and non-technological solutions, while supporting technology and non-technology transfer. Research activities with those objectives shall present tangible climate and environmental benefits in line with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050.\nArticle 5 Improving health and safety\n1. Issues concerning safety in coal mines in the process of closure and formerly operating coal mines with a view to improving working conditions, occupational health and safety, as well as environmental issues deleterious to health, shall be taken into account in the projects covering the activities referred to in Articles 4 and 6.\n2. Research projects shall focus on diseases related to mining activities with the aim of improving the health of people living in coal regions in transition. Research projects shall also ensure protective measures during the closure of mines and in formerly operating mines.\nArticle 6 Minimising the environmental impacts of coal mines in transition\n1. Research projects shall seek to minimise the impacts of coal mines in the process of closure and of formerly operating mines on the atmosphere, water and soils. Research shall be geared towards preserving and restoring natural resources for future generations and minimising the environmental impact of coal mines in the process of closure and in formerly operating mines.\n2. Preference shall be given to projects that envisage one or more of the following:\n(a) new and improved technologies to avoid environmental pollution, including methane leakage, of coal mines in the process of closure, formerly operating mines and their surroundings (including the atmosphere, land, soils and water);\n(b) capturing, avoiding and minimising greenhouse gas emissions, in particular methane, from coal deposits in the process of closure;\n(c) managing and reusing mining waste, fly ash and desulphurisation products from coal mines in the process of closure and formerly operating coal mines, as well as, where relevant, other forms of waste;\n(d) refurbishing waste heaps and using industrially residues from coal production and consumption in coal regions in transition;\n(e) protecting water tables and purifying mine drainage water;\n(f) restoring the environment of former installations or installations that are in the process of closure that used coal, and their surroundings, in particular water, land, soils and biodiversity;\n(g) protecting surface infrastructure against the effects of subsidence and ground movements in the short and long term.

            "Expected Outcome:\nThe key target of Stream D projects will be to qualify, quantify and test advanced 5G/6G technologies enablement effect and impact in and for vertical sectors. Where relevant, the projects should aim to take advantage of developed platforms and/or elements from previous SNS Stream B, C and D projects, and if needed, up-grade them to keep them operational for next SNS phases, as well as platforms developed in the context of national initiatives or any other EU based solutions that integrate and offer preliminary 6G network solutions. It is relevant in this context all the computing platform initiatives being developed at national and international level.\nThe key expected outcomes are:\nEvaluation, measurement and validation of advanced 5G/6G technologies.\nContribution to the further refinement of seamless E2E 6G test infrastructures with fine-tuned capability to integrate vertical use cases specific performance/KPI and KVIs requirements, as applicable also across public and non-public networks and services.\nValidated infrastructure core technologies and architectures, for public and private deployments, across the value chain in the context of vertical trials and pilots use-case implementations and relevant deployment scenarios targeting tangible sustainability results (in terms of societal, business and environmental aspects).\nViable business models for innovative digital use cases tested across various vertical sectors.\nMature solutions of high potential to be adopted from verticals after the completion of the project.\nSupport to impactful contributions towards standardisation bodies notably for 6G use cases and technologies, including KVIs.\nEuropean 5G Advanced and 6G know-how showcasing. Visible events widely open and inclusively accessible to the public are particularly relevant.\nOnboarding of vertical stakeholders, SMEs and the European Academic and Research community to engage in experimental activities in a timely fashion, aimed to validate technological trends.\nCollection of requirements from verticals and collection of “lessons learned” to prepare for subsequent phases of the SNS programme.\nContribution to a repository of open-source tools and modules that may be openly accessed and used by SNS projects over the programme’s lifetime.\nObjective:\nPlease refer to the \"Specific Challenges and Objectives\" section for Stream D in the Work Programme, available under ‘Topic Conditions and Documents - Additional Documents’.\nScope:\nThe projects are expected to cover at least:\nDemonstration of clear benefits for a limited number of verticals (i.e., 1 or maximum 2 verticals per project) with stakeholders of the considered 5G advanced/ 6G technologies and architectures in terms of innovative 6G smart networks and services addressing multiple aspects (e.g., scalability, security, resilience and performance improvements) in line with medium to long-term diverse socio-economic scenarios.\nSpecial focus on targeting and achieving, tangible results for environmental, societal and economic aspects by the end of the project.\nThe applicants should select their targeted vertical sectors according to the project objectives and use-cases, considering the vertical priorities for (1) Industry/Manufacturing (including robotics), (2) Media (including gaming, broadcasting…), (3) Transportation/Logistics, (4) Emergency and Safety Services and (5) Health (indicative order not prioritized). The afore verticals to be considered should be in line with the European view on 6G use-cases that were presented during the 3GPP SA1 Workshop in May 2024. The projects are expected to focus on specific verticals sectors (one or maximum two verticals per project, in the case of existing commonalities/complementarities between the selected two verticals; nevertheless, if addressing two verticals, applicants should still clearly indicate the centre of gravity, i.e. the main vertical of the project, for evaluation purposes).\nNote: To ensure a balanced portfolio within Stream D and to guarantee that the approved projects will have different centres of gravity from the above 5 vertical priorities, grants will be awarded to applications not only in order of ranking but at least also to one project that is the highest ranked within each of the above vertical priorities, provided that the applications attain all thresholds (and subject to available budget). Only the centre of gravity vertical area will be considered in terms of topic coverage during the evaluation process. See General call conditions, section 3.F of Appendix 1.\nThe trials and pilots should be carried out from an end-to-end perspective, with representative technologies covering the full value chain, including devices, connectivity, and service delivery. They should demonstrate the integration of different IoT/cloud/edge/computing environments (public and/or private) towards a distributed environment and dynamic resource needs with a landscape unified management able to support the emergence of a European offer and capability.\nStrong involvement of SMEs is targeted in the projects. These actors are expected to play a key role in this process with new market-driven applications that can build value on the 5G/6G infrastructure. This support will be a critical enabler of European-led innovation, fast track adoption, and stimulation of private sector investment, across verticals.\nThe performance and sustainability capabilities (in terms of business, societal and environmental aspects) are to be assessed against related KVIs and KPIs. Proposals should clearly indicate the target set of KPIs and KVIs and how this advances the state of the art. Performance improvement in all domains requires definition of a benchmark against which improvements may be evaluated. Cross-project collaboration is needed to define such a benchmark that will be part of the target outcome KPI repository of the SNS JU. It is expected that software entities implement the target services in Open-Source Code and with open interfaces for further reutilisation in subsequent SNS phases and on further vertical domain activities. Outputs of the work is expected to demonstrate the applicability of 6G KPI/KVI to specific use case requirements, i.e., to map those with higher level requirements at application level.\nSNS T&Ps are expected to attract the participation of key vertical industries in view of stimulating a strong European participation in future downstream standardisation phases. Therefore, participation of vertical and industrial actors with demonstrated strong standardisation impact is desired. It is equally important that the projects will engage key vertical stakeholders for monetising/valorising project results towards their adoption in the respective vertical sectors.\nThe Stream D projects should take advantage, where applicable, from already developed platforms and/or elements from the SNS previous Phase 1 & Phase 2 Stream B, C and D projects, platforms developed in the context of national initiatives or any other solutions that integrate and offer preliminary 6G network solutions (e.g., IPCEI-CIS). It is expected that specific adaptation/development work on the SNS or National Platforms, or any related solutions from other EC HE Cluster 4 activities, will be included in the projects under this Stream, in order to achieve the related ambitions/targets.

For this reason, for proposals under topics identified as “subject to restrictions on participation in accordance with Article 22(5) of the Horizon Europe Regulation” (in the specific conditions for eligibility), participation is limited as follows:\n- For proposals under Stream D (SNS trials and pilots with verticals), to legal entities established in Member States, Iceland, Norway and the following additional Associated Countries (Canada, Israel, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom).\nIn all topics, for the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity, may not participate in the action unless it can be demonstrated, by means of guarantees positively assessed by their eligible country of establishment, in so far this is a Member State or Associated Country, that their participation to the action would not negatively impact the Union’s strategic, assets, interests, autonomy, or security. Entities assessed as high-risk suppliers of mobile network communication equipment within the meaning of ‘restrictions for the protection of European communication networks’ (or entities fully or partially owned or controlled by a high-risk supplier) cannot submit guarantees.\nThe guarantees shall in particular substantiate that, for the purpose of the action, measures are in place to ensure that:\na. control over the applicant legal entity is not exercised in a manner that retrains or restricts its ability to carry out the action and to deliver results, that imposes restrictions concerning its infrastructure, facilities, assets, resources, intellectual property or know-how needed for the purpose of the action, or that undermines its capabilities and standards necessary to carry out the action;\nb. access by a non-eligible country or by a non-eligible country entity to sensitive information relating to the action is prevented; and the employees or other persons involved in the action have a national security clearance issued by an eligible country, where appropriate;\nc. ownership of the intellectual property arising from, and the results of, the action remain within the recipient during and after completion of the action, are not subject to control or restrictions by non-eligible countries or non-eligible country entity, and are not exported outside the eligible countries, nor is access to them from outside the eligible countries granted, without the approval of the eligible country in which the legal entity is established.\nRestrictions for the protection of European communication networks\nThese restrictions apply in accordance with General Annex B of the General Annexes of the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2025:\nEntities that are assessed as high-risk suppliers of mobile network communication equipment within the meaning of ‘restrictions for the protection of European communication networks’ (or entities they fully or partially own or control) are not eligible to participate as beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated partners\nLegal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government-controlled territories of Ukraine\nGiven the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non-government-controlled territories of Ukraine. Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014), legal entities established outside Russia but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by legal persons established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in any capacity.\n3. Other Eligible Conditions\ndescribed in Annex B of the Work Programme General Annexes and with the following additional requirement:\nAt least half of the budget should be implemented by the SNS JU member (other than the Union) and their constituent or affiliated entities.\nApplicants will be invited to fill a mandatory table of compliance at proposal stage in the Application Form Technical Description (Part B). Proposals that do not fulfil the above conditions, including the mandatory table of compliance, at the time of the proposal submission, will be considered ineligible and, therefore, will not be evaluated.\nGender equality plans and gender dimension of R&I:\nAccording to the General Annexes, provision of a gender equality plan for public bodies, research organisations or higher education establishments (including private research organisations and higher education establishments) applies as per Part B of the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2025. Additional gender issues (related to award sub-criterion consideration of the gender dimension in research and innovation content) shall be addressed as appropriate in case research results are expected to differ when applied to different gender populations of users.\n4. Financial and operational capacity and exclusion\nGeneral Annex C of the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2025 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the SNS call 2024 covered by this Work Programme.\n5a. Evaluation and award: Award criteria, scoring and thresholds\nare described in Annex D of the Work Programme General Annexes.\nPart D of the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2025 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the SNS call 2025 covered by this Work Programme with the following complements:\nThe award criteria table is complemented as follows:\nIntroduction in the impact section of a sub-criterion assessing the proposal contribution to the overall SME objective as appropriate;\nIntroduction in the impact section of a sub-criterion assessing the proposal contribution to the IKOP objectives;\n\n\n5b. Evaluation and award: Submission and evaluation processes\nare described in Annex F of the Work Programme General Annexes and the Online Manual.\n5c. Evaluation and award: Indicative timeline for evaluation and grant agreement\nGeneral Annex F of the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2025 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the SNS call 2025 covered by this Work Programme with the following amendments related to the procedure to rank proposals:\n- When two IA proposals are equally ranked and that it has not been possible to separate them using first the coverage criterion, second the impact criterion, and third the excellence criterion (i.e., after step 2 of the procedure outlined in part F of the General Annex), the level of SME participation will be taken as the next criterion to sort out the ties and if still un\u0002conclusive, the level of IKOP will be considered as appropriate. If still inconclusive, the procedure outlined in part F of the General Annex will be resumed from step 3 onwards.\nTo ensure a balanced portfolio within Stream D and to guarantee that the approved projects will have different centre of gravity from the identified vertical priorities (i.e., Industry/Manufacturing, Media, Transportation/Logistics, Emergency and Safety Services and Health), grants will be awarded to proposals not only in order of ranking but at least also to one project that is the highest ranked within each of the above vertical priorities, provided that the proposals attain all thresholds (and subject to available budget). Only the centre of gravity vertical area will be considered in terms of topic coverage during the evaluation process.\n6. Legal and financial set-up of the grants\nGeneral Annex G of the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2025 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the SNS call 2025 covered by this Work Programme.

National Coalitions are multi-stakeholder partnerships that bring together a diverse range of actors—including ICT and ICT-intensive companies, training providers, education and employment ministries, public and private employment services, and civil society organisations—with the aim of developing concrete measures to deliver digital skills at every level of society within their countries. For new National Coalitions, this includes their establishment and the development of national websites that are seamlessly integrated with the Core Platform and interoperable with national, regional, and local stakeholders. For existing National Coalitions with websites already funded under the CEF-TC 2019–2020 calls, FSTP will support the upgrading and maintenance of digital infrastructure, enhancement of data exchange capabilities, and improved usability and accessibility to foster greater stakeholder engagement and content dissemination. The allocation of FSTP will be based on the scope and scale of activities to be performed by each NC. This mechanism will play a crucial role in strengthening the overall network of NCs, fostering collaboration and ensuring effective skills development across all participating countries.",

For existing National Coalitions with websites already funded under the CEF-TC 2019–2020 calls, FSTP will support the upgrading and maintenance of digital infrastructure, enhancement of data exchange capabilities, and improved usability and accessibility to foster greater stakeholder engagement and content dissemination.",
            "The allocation of FSTP will be based on the scope and scale of activities to be performed by each NC. This mechanism will play a crucial role in strengthening the overall network of NCs, fostering collaboration and ensuring effective skills development across all participating countries."

            "**Activity 1:**: The outcomes of this FSTP call will vary depending on the status of the National Coalition applicants. The main distinction lies in Activity 1, as newly established NCs or those without a national website will be required to develop a new national website and connect it to the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform (DSJP). Existing NCs with operational websites will receive funding for the technical maintenance, upgrading, and security updates of their platforms. All National Coalition applicants must implement the activities outlined in Activity 2 and Activity 3 to ensure a cohesive and comprehensive approach to digital skills development across Europe.\nIn  Web Development, new National Coalitions must develop a national website/database that will serve as a structured and coherent web antenna to the DSJP, providing content and data on digital skills and jobs in the official language(s) of their country. These websites must include interoperable links to the Core Platform, ensuring alignment with technical specifications. For NCs with existing national websites, the focus will be on upgrading, maintenance, and implementing security updates, ensuring continued functionality and reliability. \nActivity 2: Services, Content, and Community-Related Activities will require all NCs to develop and manage relevant digital skills content on their national websites. This includes presenting information about the National Coalition and its members, as well as curating and displaying relevant EU initiatives, funding opportunities, events, and training resources from the Core Platform. Each NC will implement an interoperable repository of good practices connected to the Core Platform and a repository of resources on digital skills, including strategies, training materials, case studies, and non-proprietary MOOCs. They will also highlight advanced digital skills training opportunities, ensuring accessibility across various learning formats and educational providers. \nTo further support digital skills promotion, NCs will present funding opportunities at national and EU levels, publish relevant events in an online calendar, and produce news and skills intelligence reports to inform stakeholders about digital skills needs in their country. Additionally, they will organise webinars, online events, and peer-to-peer learning exchanges, contributing to the knowledge-sharing and community-building efforts of DSJP. Communication, promotion, and community management activities will also be a key focus, ensuring the visibility and engagement of stakeholders through press releases, newsletters, social media, and digital outreach strategies. \nActivity 3: Post-Editing and Localisation of Content will ensure that all National Coalitions translate and localise relevant content between English and their official language(s), making information accessible to national audiences while also sharing valuable national insights with the wider European digital skills community. This includes translating and reviewing EU policy information, skills intelligence, best practices, funding and training opportunities, news, and events. To facilitate efficient translation, NCs will have access to the European Commission’s translation system (eTranslation), with the responsibility of reviewing and refining machine-generated translations before publication results.  \nConcrete actions \nMore concretely the objectives stated above will be addressed via a number of concrete actions. National Coalitions websites are a gateway to variety of opportunities to empower citizens and organisation into their digital transition by offering relevant training opportunities, news, events, expert articles, etc to support skilling and upskilling. In particular, with regard to the outputs published on the National Coalitions websites, every National Coalition will meet the following KPIs: \nLaunch a national website and connect it to the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform (for newly established National Coalitions).  \nPresentation of the National Coalition and its members/activities in 4 categories \nOverview of relevant national and regional strategies with description \nOverview of EU initiatives and programmes in digital skills and jobs, relevant news and events \nPresentation of 20 good practices from the national/regional/local level, with in depth \nPresentation of 3 good practices \nPresentation of 8 good practices from the Core Platform published on the national website \nPresentation of 10 resources on digital skills \nPresentation of 50 training opportunities targeting different groups of end- users \nPresentation of 10 national and international financing opportunities in the field of digital skills \nPublication of at least 20 relevant events in the calendar \nPublication of at least 3 original news/announcements per month \nPublication of at least 3 news/announcements per month transferred from the Core Platform \nPublication and distribution of 2 original press releases per year \nOrganisation of at least 2 events, reaching on average 50 participants per event \nEach National Coalition will use the e-Translation tool on the Core Platform to translate content from their national website and publish it on the Core Platform. \nEach National Coalition must contribute at least 45 content items to the Core Platform. \nAdditionally, each National Coalition must pull and translate at least 120 content items from the Core Platform to publish on their national website",

These facilities are referred to as ambulatory surgical centres (ASCs).\nThe actions under this topic contribute to all the following outcomes:\nconsensus-based understanding on the hurdles, needs and requirements to establish ASCs within a European healthcare setting with a regional/national expert committee driving the community involved and acting as reference opinion leaders;\ncomprehensive framework and ‘know how’ for establishing ASC facilities with details on infrastructure, medical technology, protocols and healthcare resources required for establishing new facilities;\ntraining schemes and programmes including care pathways and enhanced recovery protocols for all health care providers (HCPs) involved in ASCs in orthopaedics and cardiology, operating safe scalable models that achieve high quality results;\ncreation of a clinical database and generation of economical evidence forming a basis towards European acceptance, standardisation and funding allowing establishment of ASC services as an integrated part of healthcare services provided;\nthe availability of an interoperable IT technology solution required to integrate clinical data from multiple stages of the patient journey and the related digital health solutions for patient preparation, post-discharge management and home monitoring.\nTarget group for the outcomes are:\nhospital managers, healthcare system providers, medical technologies and digital companies seeking solutions in European, national and regional healthcare services, to address capacity and efficiency hurdles in hospitals in the fields of orthopaedics and cardiology;\nHCPs establishing ASCs in orthopaedics and cardiology to further provide and advance healthcare services and efficiency;\npatient groups and carer associations working towards patient access to more convenient locations, shorter waiting times and easier scheduling (relative to hospital inpatient and outpatient procedures). This will improve patient experience, satisfaction and outcomes from pre-procedure to recovery at home;\nHCPs and researchers working on incorporating advanced medical technology in and out of hospital settings for improved patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency;\nreimbursement bodies as well as HTA bodies providing guidelines and innovative payment schemes.\nScope:\nThe EU’s ageing population and a rising burden of diseases and disorders, in particular noncommunicable diseases (such as cardiometabolic diseases, cancers, neurodegenerative or musculoskeletal disorders), have resulted in increasing health care costs and limited procedural capacity in operating rooms and cath labs (catheterisation laboratory). Lack of specialists is also an issue. This delays patient access to health care and increases the need for alternative and more cost-effective forms of care [5]. The shift of inpatient surgeries and treatments to ambulatory surgical centres (ASCs) could potentially provide a solution to the hospital capacity problem as well as reducing hospital acquired complications and providing improved access to healthcare services for patients in rural areas. ASCs are healthcare facilities focused on providing same-day surgical care, including diagnostic and preventative procedures for patients who do not require overnight stays. It is believed that ASCs can transform the outpatient experience for patients by providing them with a more convenient alternative to hospital-based outpatient procedures. ASCs can be operated by private or public healthcare services.\nNumerous factors influence whether surgical procedures can be carried out within ambulatory surgical centres. The key drivers are changes and further development in clinical practice and medical technology. The action funded under this topic will be focused on ASCs specialised in orthopaedics for knee and hip joint replacement surgery as well as ASCs specialised in cardiology for cardiac ablation procedures and elective rhythmology. All of these procedures are elective and will increase in the next years due to the ageing population, improved diagnostics and extension of medical guidelines. Based on patient selection, these procedures have been proven suitable for ambulatory settings. This is reinforced by the downward trend in length of stay in hospitals for these procedures in recent years. This also reflects developments in medical technology in these procedures over the last years, that have led to more precise, faster, easier, gentler and more patient-specific interventions. Shifting those procedures from hospitals into ASCs can help to relieve inpatient capacities, enabling faster patient access to those surgeries and in the end reducing overall health care costs. It is important to stress that treatment in ASCs requires good patient selection prior to the surgery based on medical classifications – like the American Society of Anaesthesiologists’ risk classification for estimating the perioperative risk – and social factors, such as the individual domestic situation of the patient, to make the intervention in ASC successful. Severe and complicated cases will still have to be treated in hospitals.\nASCs offer a lot of benefits to the health care system and can address some problems associated with inpatient treatments in hospitals. Studies show that outpatient procedures are safe and can achieve similar or superior functional outcomes compared to inpatient procedures and, for example, the early mobilisation facilitated by outpatient pathway in hip and knee replacement surgeries contributes to faster recovery timelines [1] [2].\nDue to the fact that the costly infrastructure of the hospital is not needed, and patients go home the same day after an outpatient procedure, the shift of procedures into the outpatient setting results in significant cost savings (an outpatient total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) results in a 40% decrease in charges [3] and unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) saving up to roughly EUR 18 000 [USD 20 500] per patient [4]). Enhanced healthcare resource utilisation and reduced patient waiting times are additional benefits. Additionally, there are also some patient-related benefits of outpatient procedures. It is proven that patients benefit from recovering in familiar home setting, with various technologies to help monitor their recovery and provide them with access to HCPs. This reduces anxiety [1] and leads to earlier mobility, thus a faster recovery time and a quicker return to daily activities. Overall, this enhances patient satisfaction [1] [2]. On top of that, ASCs decrease the risk of nosocomial infections with the reduced exposure to hospitals environment.\nEffective implementation of ASCs faces multiple hurdles including:\nreimbursement models: lack of reimbursement and funding procedures, limiting financial incentives to move procedures from in-hospital to ASCs;\nstakeholder acceptance: non-clinical decision-makers are not fully comfortable with ASC as a part of the solution to the capacity and demand problem;\nevidence: lack/limitation of safety and quality data measuring performance and outcomes;\nhuman resource readiness: HCPs are not trained to perform in ASCs and run them efficiently;\ndigital infrastructure: data privacy hurdles, interoperability, digital exclusions;\nprotocols: lack of standardised care models across different therapies. Limited implementation of patient-centred evidence-based approaches for quicker and improved recoveries – enhanced recovery programmes;\npatient readiness: patient expectations and previous experiences making them unwilling to accept procedures in ASCs;\nhome recovery and care system: lack of integration of ASCs with the broader healthcare systems.\nApplicants should envisage the following activities as part of the action funded under this topic:\nEstablish a multistakeholder advisory board leading and advocating for change in national and regional healthcare services. The advisory board will quantify the requirements for establishing ASCs in orthopaedics and cardiology including different financial and resource models, training modules, reimbursement pathways, digital health solutions for patient preparation and post-discharge management, registry databases as well as clinical and economical end points required for studies and reimbursement pathways;\nDemonstrate the safety of targeted procedures for patients performed in ASC facilities through the conduct of two medical cohort studies: one in orthopaedic joint replacement and another in cardiology cardiac ablation. These studies will assess the risks, patient medical eligibility complications, and patient outcomes of ASCs in comparison to hospital-based procedures;\nGenerate and share protocols and best practices across multiple centres in same country and beyond borders, including a strategy for contextual adaptation for ASC scalability across Europe;\nCreate a network of selected ASCs, with successful ASCs leading in sharing best practice, protocols, trainings, and efficiency models;\nCollect real world evidence (RWE) to demonstrate and model the cost-effectiveness of ASCs vs hospital-based procedures. The study should be multicentre and will establish a registry database answering proposed research questions;\nDevelop a shared framework for clinical data interoperability, and combine an interoperable IT technology solution to integrate clinical data collected at multiple stages of the patient journey with the related digital health solutions that are used for patient preparation, post-discharge management and home monitoring. Adequate consideration should be given to relevant ethical and privacy aspects.\nProvide a sustainability strategy for the maintenance, update, and validation of the project’s results beyond the project duration.\nApplicants should consider learnings and synergies with relevant initiatives at national and European level to maximise the potential impact of the future project.

            "Expected Impact:\nThe action under this topic is expected to achieve the following impacts:\naccelerate the EU’s access to more cost-effective interventions for the most burdensome diseases;\ndecrease the risk of developing serious diseases later in life by defining specific prevention strategies;\ncontribute to halting the progression of chronic diseases by using biomarkers in early interventions;\nimprove the quality of life for healthy individuals and patients by preventing further health decline, avoiding escalating care costs, and properly stratifying individuals and patients earlier in the diagnostic pathway;\naccelerate the adoption of innovative approaches to diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies, strengthening the EU positioning as an innovator in healthcare.\nThe action will also support the EU political priority to boost European competitiveness and contribute to a number of European policies/initiatives, which include the European Commission’s European Health Data Space Regulation (EHDS)1 and the EU Artificial Intelligence Act2.\n1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500327\n2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R1689\nExpected Outcome:\nThe action under this topic must contribute to all of the following outcomes:\n1. Accelerated access to interventions: A better understanding of the potential causal links between infections and non-communicable diseases and their accompanying biomarkers could:\nmore precisely define a person’s level of risk for long term health complications\nlead to the development of better diagnostic approaches such as early detection and monitoring strategies that will make preventive medicine more effective for the benefit of patients.\n2. Development of vaccine strategies:A better understanding of the potential causal links between infections and chronic diseases could lead to the generation of vaccine strategies with the capacity to prevent the development of one or more chronic diseases over the course of a person’s life, significantly reducing the long-term burden of disease.\n3. Early intervention strategies:A clear understanding of the mechanisms of action used by infections to cause chronic diseases could more precisely define which cellular processes, metabolic pathways, enzymatic activities, and gene expression changes should be the focus of early intervention strategies. These strategies could halt or potentially reverse the progression of chronic diseases and would aim to replace many current treatments that only manage symptoms.\n4. Improved quality of life:A better understanding of the potential causal links between infections and chronic diseases, as well as the biomarkers and mechanisms of action involved, could more precisely define development strategies for prophylactic vaccines, early diagnosis, and early intervention therapeutics that could significantly improve the quality of life of individuals by preventing health decline and avoiding escalating healthcare costs.\n5. Adoption of innovative approaches:The establishment of a more systematic collaborative approach to mining existing research cohorts and biobanks to determine potentially causal links between infections and chronic diseases by combining multi-omics, artificial intelligence, and pre-clinical model verification to potentially accelerate the development of prophylactic vaccine, early diagnostic and early intervention strategies.\nScope:\nInfectious agent (IA) and non-communicable disease (NCD) interplay has driven effective prevention strategies. However, a growing field of research suggests that there are many unexplored connections between IAs and NCDs that could be utilised to develop better diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic approaches to burdensome diseases. A cohort analysis identified 96 distinct NCDs correlated to IAs [1]. Other cohort analyses identified neurodegenerative diseases, defined as the progressive loss of neurons resulting in loss of motor function or cognition, with links to viral infection [2], including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dementia, vascular dementia, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. IA links to cardio-metabolic NCDs such as HSV (Herpes simplex viruses) and coronary artery disease [3], CMV (cytomegalovirus), EBV (Epstein-Barr virus), VZV (varicella-zoster virus), influenza and parvovirus B19 have been shown to induce cardiomyopathies [4], and H. pylori infections may drive myocardial infarction [5].\nWhile cancer, autoimmune, neurological, and cardiometabolic NCDs all have significant links to IAs, the scope of this topic is focused on neurodegenerative and cardiometabolic diseases, which carry significant disease burdens, potentially caused by direct, immune-mediated, or microbiota-gut-brain-axis damage/dysregulation, and lack early intervention strategies. Via the action funded under this topic, Europe’s research community could potentially find more infection-based approaches for diagnosing, preventing, and treating NCDs.\nThe action funded under this topic aims to identify potential causal links and biomarkers leading to mechanism of action (MoA) studies. The literature [6][7][8] demonstrates research cohorts’ utility in exploring the interplay between IAs and NCDs, increasing the likelihood of success. For instance, causative links were determined for oncolytic viruses, EBV [9] and human papillomavirus (HPV) [10], using Hill’s causation criteria. The action funded under this topic should:\ndevelop methodologies to demonstrate non-carcinogenic IA to NCD causal relationships;\nconsolidate data in one repository of IA/NCD causal relationships, biomarkers, and MoA\nApplicants are expected to define a strategy to assess non-carcinogenic infection-associated NCD causative links and related biomarkers, incorporating a modelling perspective alongside AI-assisted data mining, appropriate statistical methodologies, and prioritisation approaches for the exploration of mechanisms of action (MoA). Applicants should also detail their methodological approach and data collection procedures, providing preliminary data to show potential for success and strategies for mitigating main methodological risks and limitations.\nAs part of the first objective of proposed activities, applicants should work toward generating robust evidence toward proof of causality rather than only strengthening the known associations of IAs and NCDs. Applicants should take advantage of the available research cohorts, biobanks, and exposome data, including microbiota-gut-brain-axis samples from large general population studies, neurodegenerative disease cohorts, or cardiovascular disease cohorts. Association strength, consistency, and specificity should be indicated by similarity of measurement across different cohorts. Insurance data could be used to analyse temporality where infection occurs prior to medically attended disease. Cohorts from patients that have received transplants or immunosuppressive treatments with longitudinal data could demonstrate temporality and biological gradient effects from opportunistic infections, the strength of the immune response to IAs to demonstrate elements of causality driven by immune-mediated damage. Selection of research cohorts should prioritise data sets with populations from diverse ethnicities, socio-economic statuses, and balanced for gender. Applicants should develop/use pre-clinical models for causal link plausibility verification. Applicants are expected to follow and comply with all relevant ethical and data privacy standards for research. Applicants are also expected to conduct their consortium work with full transparency, clearly communicating data provenance, model interpretability, traceability, and limitations, especially when using AI modelling and decision-making.\nThe second objective is identifying novel biomarkers, ideally to classify associated IAs, to better stratify individuals (children, adults, the elderly) who are at risk of developing NCDs post infection. This could be done using immune or metabolic markers, host and microbiome metabolomics, sequencing, etc. This pillar can utilise the same cohorts, biobanks, and exposome data used for pillar 1 if sufficient, but should supplement with additional cohorts where needed. To ensure outcomes within the 5-year timeframe of the project, the launch of new prospective cohorts is out of scope but limited recruitment to fill specific data gaps in existing cohorts could be considered.\nThe third objective is to define the MoA that IAs use to drive NCD development. MoA identification would require tissue samples from pillars 1 & 2, as well as pre-clinical or in silico experimentation according to the targeted conditions or diseases.\nNo product development is expected from this action in the proposed timeline.\nApplicants are expected to consider the potential regulatory impact of the results and, as relevant, develop a regulatory strategy and interaction plan for generating appropriate evidence as well as engaging with regulators in a timely manner. Additionally, applicants should anticipate engaging regional healthcare systems and authorities to prepare for clinical implementation and outcome acceptance when necessary.\nApplicants should include in their proposal a strategy to ensure sustainability of the outputs of the project beyond the funding period.\nThe funded project should explore synergies with the funded project from IHI Call 11 Topic ‘Towards precision medicine: platform for transdiagnostic stratification of brain dysfunction’ (once the funded projects are awarded) to increase impact. Applicants are also expected to consider synergies with other relevant global, European and national initiatives including projects generated from Cluster Health topic \"Relationship between infections and non-communicable diseases (HORIZON-HLTH-2023-DISEASE-03-07).

Collaboration with professional societies will drive the development of clinical pathways, ensuring the generation of appropriate evidence for integrating cell-based therapies into standard diabetes care.\nAcademia, industry, regulatory agencies, patient organisations, people living with diabetes and policymakers will collaborate through fully operational European innovation hubs, facilitating knowledge sharing, driving research advancements, and harmonising regulatory practices to accelerate the adoption and implementation of beta-cell therapies across Europe.\nPeople living with diabetes will benefit from all these outcomes, as they will lead to improved treatment options, enhanced long-term health outcomes, better access to innovative therapies, and an overall improved quality of life.\nIt is expected that certain existing assets will be used as background in this action. Such background assets may include, but are not limited to, cell manufacturing technologies, gene editing platforms, scaffold materials, encapsulation systems, and delivery and release technologies, among others. The exact nature of the background to be brought into the project will depend on the proposals presented by the public consortia. Therefore, beneficiaries intending to participate in this action need to be comfortable with the principle that ownership of specific deliverables / project results which would be considered direct improvements to a beneficiary’s background asset, will need to be transferred back to the beneficiary who contributed the background asset to the project. Provision for and conditions relating to such transfers should be specified in the project’s consortium agreement.\nScope:\nChallenges and Background\nT1D is an autoimmune disease that destroys insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells, leading to lifelong insulin dependence. Despite advances in technology, achieving stable blood glucose levels remains challenging, which increases the risk of severe complications, and this in turn impacts negatively on daily life, work productivity, and mental health, and contributes to stress, anxiety, and depression.\nBeta-cell replacement therapy offers a promising path towards a functional cure, but critical challenges must be addressed, including the need for renewable cell sources, optimised islet preparations, standardised manufacturing protocols, robust monitoring tools, sustainable reimbursement models, and trained healthcare professionals to manage complex treatments. These challenges align with key priorities from the Draghi Report , emphasising harmonised regulatory pathways, early engagement with HTA bodies, standardised manufacturing processes, and patient-centred clinical endpoints. Without urgent action, the full potential of beta-cell therapies will remain unrealised.\nKey Objectives:\n1) Establishing standardised criteria and analytical methods:This objective aims at developing standardised criteria and analytical methodologies to detect, quantify, and characterise unintended bystander cells and impurities in stem cell-derived or beta-cell therapies for T1D. This work is intended to support the field at large by generating reference materials, optimising detection technologies, and defining regulatory-compliant thresholds that can inform future research and development—not to advance a specific product. The focus is on creating translatable, broadly applicable tools and standards that ensure safety, consistency, and quality. Engagement with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is encouraged to facilitate the regulatory relevance and potential adoption of these methodologies in preclinical and clinical research settings.\n2) Enhancing graft survival and immune tolerance:This objective aims at developing immune-modulating strategies that support the long-term survival of beta-cell grafts and promote immune tolerance. This work is intended to generate insights, tools, and models that advance scientific understanding and inform future therapeutic approaches. Activities will include retrospective analyses of human cadaveric islet transplantation cohorts from different European countries and healthcare systems to support biomarker discovery and predictive modelling. Key biomarkers – such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics, C-peptide levels, HbA1c, inflammatory cytokines, immune cell subsets, beta-cell-specific autoantibodies, and gene expression profiles – will be explored to identify indicators of graft survival, immune tolerance, and beta-cell function. In addition, a prospective study may be designed to identify novel biomarkers related to glycaemic variability, immune regulation, insulin independence, beta-cell regeneration, and inflammatory pathways. These efforts are aimed at supporting the development of robust monitoring tools and decision-making frameworks, not at advancing a therapeutic candidate toward clinical use.\n3) Advancing manufacturing and quality control:The objective is to establish robust cryopreservation techniques that preserve the viability and functionality of beta-cells post-thaw, with an emphasis on the identification and validation of biomarkers to guide and assess these processes. Building on this, the applicants should aim to develop and optimise scalable, cost-effective manufacturing methodologies and quality control frameworks that support the production of consistent, high-quality beta-cell therapy materials in a research and innovation context. The goal is to generate foundational knowledge, technical standards, and reference systems, not to develop specific commercial products. Additionally, the consortium should work toward establishing standardised criteria for the production and quality control of excipient raw materials used in beta-cell therapy delivery systems, to ensure their stability, safety, and suitability for future clinical applications.\n4) Streamlining preclinical and clinical development:This objective aims at enhancing preclinical models for allogeneic cell therapies, ensuring standardised approaches and consistent methodologies in transplantation science and surgery. The focus is on harmonised regulatory approval, defining patient demographics for broader accessibility, and tailoring treatment requirements for personalised care. Establishing definitions for insulin independence, investigating and working toward the regulatory acceptance of clinically meaningful endpoints, such as ‘Time in Range (TIR)’ and ‘Time in Tight Range (TiTR)’, and optimising clinical trial design for allogeneic therapies are essential components of the future project.\n5) Implementing advanced monitoring and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictive tools:Leveraging real-time monitoring technologies like continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and biosensors to assess transplant success and metabolic function, this objective aims to integrate advanced techniques from various fields, including oncology. Specifically, immune monitoring strategies used in oncology, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and tumour biomarker profiling, will be explored to enhance the understanding of immune responses in beta-cell transplantation. AI-powered predictive models will personalise treatment plans and optimise immunosuppression regimens. Additionally, non-invasive imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), will track graft survival and immune responses, ensuring better monitoring and management of beta-cell therapies. The action should also reinforce transparency requirements, including model interoperability, data provenance, and traceability of AI decision-making processes.\n6) Defining clinically meaningful and patient-centred endpoints using real-world evidence:This objective aims at leveraging real-world data to define clinically meaningful endpoints that capture quality of life and disease burden in T1D. This includes identifying surrogate endpoints to enable clinical trials that demonstrate long-term benefits without requiring extended study durations. Additionally, generating data on the advantages of achieving normoglycemia in individuals already within target glucose ranges will help refine treatment goals and support regulatory decision-making. A small pilot study must be conducted to test these endpoints and gather initial data on their feasibility and impact.\n7) Exploring reimbursement models for beta-cell therapies:This objective aims at developing initial cost-effectiveness models that highlight the potential financial and healthcare benefits of beta-cell therapies, focusing on key aspects like reduced complications and improved quality of life. Early-stage collaboration with health technology assessment (HTA) bodies, payers, and policymakers must be sought to help build a foundation for understanding the value of these therapies, laying the groundwork for future integration into healthcare systems across Europe.\n8) Integration of cell therapy into diabetes care and collaborative networks:Beta-cell therapies should be integrated into standard diabetes care through specialised training for healthcare providers and the creation of a network of multidisciplinary centres across Europe. Clinical guidelines should be put in place to ensure a smooth transition from current treatments. Additionally, a network of European innovation hubs must be established to foster collaboration, knowledge exchange, and harmonised regulatory approaches, accelerating the development and clinical application of beta-cell therapies. It will also be crucial to collaborate with professional societies to define a clear clinical pathway, ensuring alignment with best practices and optimising patient outcomes across the region.\nAdditional key considerations:\nApplicants are expected to consider a sustainability plan for the maintenance, update, and validation of the project's results beyond the project’s duration to ensure long-term impact and continual improvements.\nApplicants are expected to consider the potential regulatory impact of the results and, as relevant, develop a regulatory strategy and interaction plan for generating appropriate evidence as well as engaging with regulators in a timely manner (e.g. national competent authorities, EMA Innovation Task Force, qualification advice).\nApplicants are expected to ensure transparent and open dissemination of outcomes, including models and tools, to enable their integration and reuse throughout the wider ecosystem.\nApplicants should give adequate consideration in the ethical standards and data privacy frameworks applicable to the use of personal health data and biobanks.\nThe action funded under this topic is also expected to explore synergies with complementary initiatives to advance research and innovation in Europe, such as NHPIG1, which is developing the first T1D autoimmune pig model, the Vanguard-project2, the Islet-project3, JOIN4ATMP4, and relevant Horizon 2020/Europe projects. Furthermore, the project should explore synergies with the European Pancreas and Islet Transplantation Registry (EPITR)5, an initiative led by the European Pancreas and Islet Transplant Association (EPITA) to establish a pan-European registry collecting data on individuals who have received pancreas or islet transplants. By leveraging their insights and networks, the project aims to strengthen the impact of beta-cell therapy development, ensuring that these collaborations contribute to a more comprehensive and effective approach to tackling T1D through cell-based therapies.\n1 https://www.nhpig.eu/\n2 https://vanguard-project.eu/\n3 https://isletproject.eu/\n4 https://www.join4atmp.eu/\n5 https://esot.org/epita/epita-epitr/ [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500327](https://eur06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feur-lex.europa.eu%2Flegal-content%2FEN%2FTXT%2F%3Furi%3DOJ%3AL_202500327&data=05%7C02%7CKlelia.Salpea%40ihi.europa.eu%7C9750d673607a44d3ac5a08dd8cbd4d7b%7C15f479aeff4c4645a525460e287e143b%7C0%7C0%7C638821466862285326%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=o5J5QgeB%2Fb3mvb1y%2BYpSEZGod0%2BYywkLuHkxeI49%2BAw%3D&reserved=0) [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R1689](https://eur06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feur-lex.europa.eu%2Flegal-content%2FEN%2FTXT%2F%3Furi%3DCELEX%3A32024R1689&data=05%7C02%7CKlelia.Salpea%40ihi.europa.eu%7C9750d673607a44d3ac5a08dd8cbd4d7b%7C15f479aeff4c4645a525460e287e143b%7C0%7C0%7C638821466862302369%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=BHTKf%2FHdHbZKckm32Yvhd6f1uXmvKUpSXqFEGxLRKhQ%3D&reserved=0) [https://www.nhpig.eu/](http://www.nhpig.eu/) [https://vanguard-project.eu/](http://vanguard-project.eu/) [https://isletproject.eu/](http://isletproject.eu/) [https://www.join4atmp.eu/](http://www.join4atmp.eu/) [https://esot.org/epita/epita-epitr/](http://esot.org/epita/epita-epitr/) Show less"
